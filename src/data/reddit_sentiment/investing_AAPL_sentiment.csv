0,AAPL,1669690047.0,Regarding the most feasible education investment option for my kids,"Dear Folks,

I moved to the states a couple of years back and have 2 kids. 

They are 8 & 14 yo now, one goes to 8th grade and another is in 2nd grade in public schools.

About my Income: I make 130k base/yr + 12k annual bonus, I save 15% of my base into 401k (close to 90k now) and 10% goes to ESPP (just started last month). After taxes + Insurance + ESPP cuts, I am left up with around 5k and my expenses are 4k-4.5k/month (rent itself is 2.2k) so there will be leftovers for $500 to 1k USD every month.

I just started putting $500 in my elder ones UTMA account and thinking of buying Dividend stocks e.g. JEPI / BST / SCHD etc but I am open to suggestions and If I shouldn't invest that amount at all as tenure is short. I also have 529s which are not mentioned below, they also have 1k each for both of them but they are not growing at all so I am not sure if it's wise to put $ in them now.

I've saved the following so far for them:

This is 99.95% lower than that of the Healthcare sector and significantly higher than that of the Drug Manufacturers—Specialty & Generic industry. The total debt for all United States stocks is 99.98% higher than that of the company.

ZOM shows a strong growth in Revenue. In the last year the revenue has grown by 40,491.41%. Therefore expecting a strong growth in revenue by 141.57% yearly. Thus ZOM has grown faster than the US drug manufacturers- specialty and generic industry average ( 89.8% ).

US total addressable market:  PulseVet 150 million + TRUFORMA 775 million + TrueView 1.3 billion + Assisi 210 million + Vet Guardian 40 million. NOTE: Total addressable market, also called total available market, is a term that is typically used to reference the revenue opportunity available for a product or service.

""Our PulseVet and TRUFORMA product sales are growing, and we are adding Revo2 and VetGuardian products to the mix. To fulfill customer demand for our expanding portfolio of products with sufficient production and efficient distribution we are committed to expanding our manufacturing capacity and capabilities,"" said Larry Heaton, Zomedica's Chief Executive Officer. ""That is reflected in the new Zomedica Global Manufacturing & Distribution Center.""


“We expect to continue to grow revenue organically as we integrate the recent acquisitions and continue to evaluate strategic business development options in the animal health sector to identify potential new opportunities to grow further through additional acquisitions “According to Larry Heaton. 

Bill Campell, Chief Executive Officer of Revo Squared stated ""We are excited to join the team at Zomedica; this deal will bring our MicroView product offering into the forefront of veterinary medicine. For the first time clinicians will be able to have hematology and cytology slides automatically smeared and stained inside a microscope, eliminating human error in slide preparation. Implementing MicroView in veterinary hospitals enhances diagnostics and reduces the wait time.""

Very knowledgeable leadership team. Larry Heaton is very transparent and informative as well as investor friendly.

Zomedica's product portfolio includes the TRUFORMA® in-clinic biosensor testing platform which offers the first and ONLY feline-optimized TSH assay capable of measuring TSH concentrations below levels appropriate for canine diagnoses.

Share BUYBACK was approved over 1.5  years ago. However IMHO this will not be implemented until they are turning great profit and the share price is under valued. 

AAPL has 17 billion shares outstanding and we have 960 million shares outstanding so no need for any future votes on RS when we are very profitable. It may take a while but worth getting in early. 

Zomedica is up-listed on NYSE American and compliance is ONLY $.20. Meaning if the stock price stays above .20 cents it will not receive any deficiency notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission and exchange rules and regulations.","ZOMEDICA a great long term investment IMHO Estimated 158 million currently in cash for future acquisitions as of November 15th ( therefore no need for another offering )

2,AAPL,1667929977.0,[Serious] Why not a portfolio of 100% Apple?,"Ok, so hear me out on this. This is something I've been thinking about and pondering for the past few weeks and it's an idea that I just can't get out of my head. 

So most every person, myself included, when asked what someone should invest in will answer with the same thing: DCA into a diversified ETF like VTI or VOO and just let it ride. That's what I've been doing myself as it follows the conventional wisdom of not putting all your eggs into one basket, protecting yourself against massive market swings, and generally allowing an individual to take the emotion out of investing and slowly grow their wealth in a safe, predictable, and emotionless manor. 

But here's the thing, Apple is already a massive percentage of all of the diversified ETFs we recommend, and it consistently outperforms them as well. 

I'm not able to share images, but tradingview offers this really cool comparison tool. If you type in AAPL/VOO you can see how valuable Apple is compared to VOO. Since VOO launched in 2010 AAPL is now sitting at 338% more valuable across 12 years. 

Then I start thinking about the broad income streams that Apple has. They have physical products, digital products, and subscriptions that generate consistent revenue. They pay a consistently increasing dividend quarterly and maintain massive market share by being, in my opinion, an ""affordable Veblen good"" or more simply put, a bit of a status symbol. Also, anecdotally, the last three companies I've worked for are using Apple hardware in their offices. It is the go-to computer for the tech-startup world.

Now I know someone has already typed out a comment saying, ""past performance is not an indicator of future gains"" to which I say bullshit. The only reason we invest in companies, ETFs, or whatever else is because we look to the past and say, ""The line has gone up for the last 10 years, surely that means the line will continue to go up for the next 10 years.""

So yeah, in all honesty, if you're planning on buying and holding for 30 years why would you not want to go all in on Apple?","[Serious] Why not a portfolio of 100% Apple? Ok, so hear me out on this.

Some of what I'm invested in is SCHB, MMM, AAPL, RUM, XLG, SPWR, PLUG, ME, and some others.

a couple months ago I was at a -53% return on all of my investments, which is kind of hilarious to me. I love watching videos about longterm trading that say things like ""If you invest $500/month for the next 40 years, you'll hit $1mil! Assuming you're making at least +20% each year"".

In my mind, that's a HUGE assumption.

Anyway, I'm still putting in money, and I've been focusing on the safer bets lately. Slowly inching lower and lower, but it's going to be a LONG crawl out of the hole I'm in.
