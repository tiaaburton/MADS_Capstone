# [S&P 500 futures rise as China Covid concerns ease](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/28/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Futures connected to the S&P 500 rose Tuesday as worries over unrest in China and its Covid protocols appeared to ease.
*****
> The broad index’s futures added 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.4%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded near flat.
*****
> The move follows stocks in Hong Kong and Shanghai rallying overnight as a Chinese official told reporters that 65.8% of people “over age 80” had received booster shots. On top of that, the government reported the first decline in Covid infections within mainland China in more than a week.
*****
> Those updates follow the declines in U.S. and foreign markets seen Monday after protests in mainland China against the country’s zero-Covid policy started over the weekend. West Texas Intermediate crude futures briefly fell to their lowest point since last December while all three of the major U.S. indexes ended the day down more than 1% as investors grew increasingly concerned about if Chinese Covid protocols could hamper global supply chains.
*****
> “There’s some real reasons to be cautious. The market’s rallied a lot this quarter, and there’s some concerns that things are going to slow, so I think it’s a kind of balanced risk reward,” Trivariate Research’s Adam Parker said Monday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
> “I think there was an excuse with maybe some China slowdown fears for people to collect a little profit that they made in the quarter,” he added.
*****
> On the economic front, traders will watch for the September reading of the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index that is due Tuesday before the bell. The report will give investors insight into how higher interest rates are affecting the housing market. Home prices in the prior month jumped about 13% year over year.
*****
> Meanwhile, the latest reading on consumer confidence is set to release at 10 a.m. Wall Street is also expecting the latest corporate earnings results from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Tuesday after the bell.
*****
> Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak at the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings on Wednesday. Investors will be listening for insight into the central bank’s fight against inflation.

# [Stock futures fall as unrest in China grows over Covid restrictions](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/27/stock-futures-slip-after-a-winning-holiday-week-.html)
*****
> Stock futures fell Monday as social unrest from China’s prolonged Covid restrictions weighed on markets, sending oil prices lower — after Wall Street notched gains during the Thanksgiving holiday-shortened week.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 178 points, or 0.5%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures each dropped 0.7%.
*****
> Over the weekend, demonstrations broke out in mainland China as people vented their frustrations with Beijing’s zero-Covid policy. Local governments tightened Covid controls as cases surged, even though earlier this month Beijing adjusted some policies that suggested the world’s second-biggest economy was on its way to reopening.
*****
> The developments weighed on sentiment in Asia trading, with oil futures hovering around new 2022 lows around demand concerns. Shares of companies with big production facilities in the country led premarket losses. Shares of Apple lost 1.7% and Tesla declined 2.2% in premarket trading.
*****
> The moves come after all three major U.S. indexes ended last week higher, even with the shortened trading time due to the Thanksgiving holiday. The Dow rose 1.78%, and the S&P 500 increased 1.53% during the short week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq lagged the other two indexes but was still up 0.72% in the same timeframe.
*****
> Stocks were lifted during the week by comments from Federal Reserve officials signaling that the central bank would step down its aggressive rate hike path as inflation cools. Minutes from the Fed’s November meeting confirmed the likely shift in policy.
*****
> “A substantial majority of participants judged that a slowing in the pace of increase would likely soon be appropriate,” the minutes stated.
*****
> In the last week of November, investors will be watching more earnings reports and a slew of economic releases that will give further information on the state of the consumer and the U.S. economy. Intuit, Salesforce and Five Below are among companies scheduled to report earnings. Personal consumption data and the labor report for November will also be released this week.

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

*****

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Monday, November 28th, 2022! :)**","(11/28) Monday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News # Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Monday, November 28th, 2022-

*****

# [Stock futures fall as unrest in China grows over Covid restrictions](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/27/stock-futures-slip-after-a-winning-holiday-week-.html)
*****
> Stock futures fell Monday as social unrest from China’s prolonged Covid restrictions weighed on markets, sending oil prices lower — after Wall Street notched gains during the Thanksgiving holiday-shortened week.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 178 points, or 0.5%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures each dropped 0.7%.
*****
> Over the weekend, demonstrations broke out in mainland China as people vented their frustrations with Beijing’s zero-Covid policy. Local governments tightened Covid controls as cases surged, even though earlier this month Beijing adjusted some policies that suggested the world’s second-biggest economy was on its way to reopening.
*****
> The developments weighed on sentiment in Asia trading, with oil futures hovering around new 2022 lows around demand concerns. Shares of companies with big production facilities in the country led premarket losses. Shares of Apple lost 1.7% and Tesla declined 2.2% in premarket trading.
*****
> The moves come after all three major U.S. indexes ended last week higher, even with the shortened trading time due to the Thanksgiving holiday. The Dow rose 1.78%, and the S&P 500 increased 1.53% during the short week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq lagged the other two indexes but was still up 0.72% in the same timeframe.
*****
> Stocks were lifted during the week by comments from Federal Reserve officials signaling that the central bank would step down its aggressive rate hike path as inflation cools. Minutes from the Fed’s November meeting confirmed the likely shift in policy.
*****
> “A substantial majority of participants judged that a slowing in the pace of increase would likely soon be appropriate,” the minutes stated.
*****
> In the last week of November, investors will be watching more earnings reports and a slew of economic releases that will give further information on the state of the consumer and the U.S. economy. Intuit, Salesforce and Five Below are among companies scheduled to report earnings. Personal consumption data and the labor report for November will also be released this week.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

15,AAPL,1668054361.0,What's propping SPY up?,"Hi,

With almost every stock hitting all-time-low, I wonder what's propping SPY up so far?

Let's take 13th Oct 2022 as the lowest so far @ $348. SPY is up 7.14% while the top 5 (worth 19% of SPY) is down 1.87%, the gap is 9%. So for the bottom 497 (503-6) stocks (81% weightage) to make up the missing 9%, they need to be collectively up by 11%.

Is my understanding of how SPY works and my math correct? If this is correct, which companies are gaining so much in the last 4 weeks (since 13th Oct 2022)?

Pardon me if I'm making a fool of myself if my understanding of the above is wrong, but that's how we learn! Thanks!

||% since 13th Oct 2022|SPY weightage|Contribution|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|SPY|\+7.14%|19.09% (SumOfTop5)|\-1.87% (SumOfTop5)|
|AAPL|\-5.68%|6.55%|\-0.37%|
|AMZN|\-23.45%|2.50%|\-0.59%|

|TSLA|\-19.90%|1.64%|\-0.33%|

&#x200B;

EDIT: u/W0rdWaster posted the right answer -- In the last 4 weeks, the top 5 in SPY  are in red, but the rest are doing very well with double-digit green, that's how 80% of the SPY is propping it up by 7%!","What's propping SPY up? Hi,

Largest position is AAPL

I think the others are AXP, BAC, CVX and KO.

Thoughts?

I did add a couple shares of CVX today at aths lol!

Hey gotta start somewhere! Maybe I can average down....

I would assume the other 27% though is his diversity?

I'm not sure how many stocks he has all together.

I'm wondering if each share of BRK.B is a snapshot of these same stocks with an equal weighting?","Warren Buffet now has 73% of his portfolio in 5 stocks? CNBC had a segment on today about Buffet and how his portfolio is currently 73% in 5 stocks if I remember correctly.

18,AAPL,1667751651.0,Advice on current stocks,"Hello,

I started investing in stocks a couple of weeks ago and use the Schwab platform. I bought 3 shares of AR, 3 shares of AAPL, 3 shares of MSFT, 2 shares of SRPT, 2 shares of EQT, and 1 share of DUOL. I use market only and all of them seem to go up and down. The inflation hike is going to just make it worse. What would you do if you were in my shoes?","Advice on current stocks Hello,

19,AAPL,1667683320.0,XLG vs S&P 500,"I was curious about people’s thoughts on investing in XLG (Invesco S&P 500® Top 50 ETF) instead of a index that tracks the full S&P 500 (VOO or SPY).

XLG tracks only the top 50 so it’s a lot more concentrated:

• VOO’s top 10 accounts for 27% 

• XLG’s top 10 accounts for 52%

• AAPL in VOO is 6.88%

• AAPL in XLG is 13.12%

My thought process here is that I’m young enough (early 20s) to take on the risk of being more heavily concentrated with the hopes that the top dogs of the S&P will outperform the bottom 450. I’d love to hear what people think of this idea. I know people say it’s hard to beat the S&P but this seems like a way to just play the S&P but with more risk/reward.","XLG vs S&P 500 I was curious about people’s thoughts on investing in XLG (Invesco S&P 500® Top 50 ETF) instead of a index that tracks the full S&P 500 (VOO or SPY).

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

21,AAPL,1667564448.0,Question about accumulating ETFs,"Let's say I hold VWCE, an accumulating fund which contains some stocks that distribute dividends (AAPL, Johnson&Johnson, etc..).  


At the end of the quarter, let's say I should get 10 bucks from dividends from those companies. However, since the fund is accumulating, where does the money go exactly? People say it's used to buy more shares of the fund, however, I never saw my shares actually increase.
