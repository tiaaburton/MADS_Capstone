According to Bloomberg, the exact size of the shortfall still remains unclear and will likely depend on manufacturer Foxconn‚Äôs ability to hire enough workers for the iPhone assembly line to keep up with production targets.

Earlier this month, Apple had cut its production target for the iPhone 14 by 3 million units due to Covid-related disruptions at the Foxconn plant and that number has now been revised by double, the report adds.

Workers at the Foxconn plant in Zhengzhou‚Äîsometimes referred to as ‚ÄúiPhone city‚Äù‚Äîhave been forced to live on-site in a closed bubble, only being allowed to move from the factory floor to their dorm rooms due to the city‚Äôs Covid control measures.

While sales of the cheaper iPhone 14 and 14 Plus have slowed down, the pricier iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max have continued to remain in strong demand in the U.S., the report adds.

While the company has diversified its manufacturing line by making some of its devices in India and Vietnam, nearly all of its flagship iPhone 14 Pro models are made in the Zhengzhou factory.

Apple‚Äôs shares were down 1.87% in pre-market trading on Monday morning following the report.

* This Week‚Äôs lotto 10 bagger Play

# $2k to $100k Challenge Update

Last week was almost Perfect, we almost got everything on the watchlist right on the money, no one can get all their plays perfectly obviously so the weeks where we do is cause for celebration at least for me.

For Earnings, we had $ZM puts, $DE puts, and $BBY calls. All ran in the direction we hoped for 100%-200% plays, except DE.

As for economic plays, we only had FOMC minutes and as expected, we got a little pump. I have zero clue why anyone on Twitter and Reddit would be bearish on minutes for a meeting that already happened and we say a dovish statement for. But each to his own, we made our $$$.

For those who don't know, I'm 33 trading days in a challenge where I trade live every day, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone every day.

**Options Starting Amount:** $1000  
**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $11,162  
**Port % Change:** 1101%

**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800  
**Day 27 Closing Amount:** $1918  
**Port % Change**: 102%

We also had call swings for AMD, AFRM, COIN, NFLX, TQQQ, SPX, TSLA, and TWST Puts.

Cashed in TWST puts for 20%, TSLA 25th calls for 50%, and SPX calls for 110% as these were close to expiring 1-2 weeks out.

Averaged down on NFLX, and AFRM, and added TSLA March ‚Äò23 swing.

As we approach the 200MA on the daily SPX, I'm moving more into cash, I'm still bullish (ill explain why later on), but not willing to risk a lot of $$ on that.

So overall we got more cash, and more positions, but NFLX dragging us down a bit so yeah still around the 11k mark, so I currently have

* AMD 03/17/2023 75.00 C
* AFRM 01/20/2023 17.50 C

Man last week was sleepy but this week is FULL of data, SUPER IMPORTANT data as well. Jobs numbers, PMI, and Inventories will all be important this week, but we will focus on a few major plays here.

**GDP Q3**

So we are getting a second estimate of the Q3 GDP for 2022. Last time we got a HUGE beat, 2.6% Actual vs 2.4% expected, a jump from -0.6 last quarter.

This month's Forcast is 2.7%, if we are able to hit 2.7% or more we should see a nice jump in the market, given that the stronger the GDP is, the stronger the economy is and the less likely we have a recession.

With USD still strong, and falling shipping costs, I think beat forecasts

**GDP Play: SPX ATM Calls 12/05 (Lotto Small Size as always)**

**JPow Speech**

JPow Speech at the brooks institute is also an important one, we all remember the Jackson Hole meeting when we were also at the 200MA on the SPX Daily, and brought the market to new lows.

A lot of people are expecting that history will repeat itself here, i disagree, using the same logic we used to predict FOMC minutes and CPI, Powell is not dovish but the data suggests a possible turnaround. He doesn't need to be hawkish because he is afraid of overtightening and the political implications that come with that.

I think we get a cautious JPow who doesn't want a market run, but also doesn't want a market crash. He doesn't need to be dovish for the market run, his lack of hawkishness would be sufficient.

**JPow play: SPX ATM Calls 12/05 (Lotto Small Size as always)**

**PCE**

Now we get PCE the next day,  which is one of the most important reports as its Jpow favorite measure of inflation, we have seen a big drop in prices last quarter, alot of which were not reflected in the last report. I believe we get a nice beat of the forecast of 5%.

# Watchlist

**- NFLX Long**

I'm still long NFLX as long as it holds the upward trendline, if I see a clear failure of the line, will be exiting my position, but if it holds, will add more. From a structural standpoint, we are putting in a higher low.

https://preview.redd.it/0vaafsrxmo2a1.jpg?width=1528&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1dcc6795c04099a286f3027b76883bc088928996

**- AAPL Long**

Has been beasting for this month, and currently forming a bull flag on the daily chart, as long as it holds the 50MA, ill be taking a long position with the 200MA as my target

**- TSLA Long**  
We got TSLA on the way up and down last week, we have a lot of bullish catalysts for TSLA till the end of the year, so I'm going long here, as long as we hold $166, which was the low of last week

# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play

My 10x play was VIX calls, which is a super obvious play given everything going in the market today, but its already up 9% at the time of writing this, we may still see 24-25 (21MA on Daily) as we progress throught the week, and it's extremely oversold. The R:R is not so great anymore for calls, but it's your call if you want to play it to 24ish level, it's still a 10%+ move.

I‚Äôll start by taking a 12/30 23c to play to 21MA on daily, if my assumptions for events are wrong ill just keep riding this 1 - 2 week out to expiry.

If my assumptions are correct with this week‚Äôs events, ill be taking profits on VIX calls and i‚Äôll be taking VIX puts at a 24ish level, and riding it all the way down to new 52-week lows. Play here would be 12/20 23p

Alright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week‚Äôs play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.

 TA on VIX, Comparing to the drawdown of 2008, 200-day MA SPY, FED literally saying they want assets to go down, huge rally from \~3490, sentiment,  inversion of the yield curve, upcoming recession, risk-free rate changing, etc. leads me to believe we are coming near the end of this bear market rally (and tells me this is just a bear market rally). Nobody can say for sure though. This is a guess that I am personally making a move on. 

Watchlist for downside: 

$AAPL, $CAT, $TR, $DE, $GS, $DJIA, $NFLX, $CMG, etc.

Will be rotating shorts around to lock in profits, reduce risk, etc.

Will also likely be increasing margin as my positions move in my favor.

* Berkshire‚Äôs operating earnings totaled $7.761 billion in the third quarter, up 20% from year-earlier period.
* The conglomerate spent $1.05 billion in share repurchases, bringing the nine-month total to $5.25 billion.
* The Omaha-based company suffered a $10.1 billion loss on its investments during the third quarter‚Äôs market turmoil, however.

Berkshire Hathaway on Saturday posted a solid gain in operating profits during the third quarter despite rising recession fears, while Warren Buffett kept buying back his stock at a modest pace.

The Omaha-based conglomerate‚Äôs operating earnings ‚Äî which encompass profits made from the myriad of businesses owned by the conglomerate like insurance, railroads and utilities ‚Äî totaled $7.761 billion in the third quarter, up 20% from year-earlier period.

Insurance-investment income came in at $1.408 billion, up from $1.161 billion a year earlier. Earnings from the company‚Äôs utilities and energy businesses came in at $1.585 billion, up from $1.496 billion year over year. Insurance underwriting suffered a loss of 962 million, however, while railroad earnings dipped to $1.442 billion from $1.538 billion in 2021.

Berkshire spent $1.05 billion in share repurchases during the quarter, bringing the nine-month total to $5.25 billion. The pace of buyback was in line with the $1 billion purchased in the second quarter. Repurchases were well below CFRA‚Äôs expectation as its analyst estimated it would be similar to the $3.2 billion total in the first quarter.

However, Berkshire did post a net loss of $2.69 billion in the third quarter, versus a $10.34 billion gain a year before. The quarterly loss was largely due to a drop in Berkshire‚Äôs equity investments amid the market‚Äôs rollercoaster ride.

Berkshire suffered a $10.1 billion loss on its investments during the quarter, bringing its 2022 decline to $63.9 billion. The legendary investor told investors again that the amount of investment losses in any given quarter is ‚Äúusually meaningless.‚Äù

Shares of Buffett‚Äôs conglomerate have been outperforming the broader market this year, with Class A shares dipping about 4% versus the S&P 500‚Ä≤s 20% decline. The stock dipped 0.6% in the third quarter.

**price\_efficiency:** how much are you losing to the bid/ask spread? Higher number the better. 

**expected\_move:** this is a percentage of the expected move, as priced by the ATM calls and puts, for this stock by expiration date (this Friday)

How to use this in your trading? 

Do you think **DASH** will move more than 14% by Friday? If not, sell options. If you think it will move for than that, I guess you might want to go long (debit) an option (not recommended). 

Do you want to trade **INTC**? Notice how the put\_IV is double that of calls. That means traders are bidding up the puts, and bidding down the calls relative to each other. If you think its going up, sell those puts and buy the calls. 

Want to trade **SBUX**? Realize that you will lose roughly 2% immediately when filling your trade and another 2% immediately when you exit. This is how the bid/ask spread works.

# Trading Thesis - Why These Crayons Taste Better

Technical analysis and indicator based trading tend to use past price performance in order to predict important price levels today. 

This analysis is based on the current option open interest. With that option open interest, it calculates portfolio-level greeks--notably Delta and Gamma. More importantly, once the portfolio level greeks are established, I can now simulate the change in greeks at different price points. From there, I can find the price levels where portfolio-level gamma is the highest, and the portfolio-level delta is close to 0. 

For some tickers, the underlying price reacts strongly off of delta neutral, gamma max, and sometimes both. 

It's the reaction off of these price levels in the past that is being used to drive trading signals. 

The plays and target entry prices given are calculated using a binomial option pricing model that reflect the expected size and duration of the reaction from gamma max or delta neutral. A lot of these plays are profitable by underlying moves in stock. The best plays benefit from the directional move as well as the increase in IV.

# Notes - Something to give you a new wrinkle

* If the price has moved past the entry price, exercise caution. Something changed between the time these plays were generated and market open. 
* Look to sell half your position on a double, and freeroll the rest to exit at your discretion. 
* I tend to risk up to 1% of my total capital on any trades I take. If my conviction is lower, I'll only allocate 0.5% or even 0.25% of my capital to the trade, and dollar cost average in. 
* The trades were calculated before market open, and so are based on information up to yesterday. Keep that in mind when deciding to enter well after the fact. 

# FAQ - Because others have already asked.

* These plays are mostly puts. Are you a gay bear?
   * No. It so happens that the companies have had some recent run-up which implies they are overextended. These trades are primarily some form of mean-reversion either toward or away from an important price level.
* Are you entering all these plays?
   * No. There have been a dearth of plays in the WSB morning talks, and so I opened up my bag of tools slightly wider to point out more plays with a probable edge to help lead apes to more gain porn. Go through this curated list of plays, pick the ones you like based on whatever additional analysis you use, and get that gain porn.
* You mentioned a new play on the same ticker in the past. What does that mean?
   * The new play should replace the old play. The old play is likely now invalid and if you haven't entered in, don't chase the price. Remember that a new day's worth of data has been produced and the newer play reflects that data, the older play does not.
* Where are the crayons? I only see words. 
   * Click the links above.
* Have you back-tested this?
   * Yes. Results show a moderate Sharpe Ratio (1.7), with an expected win rate of 63% of trades (7% margin of error)
* What is the historical performance?
   * The realized Sharpe Ratio is 1.85 with a 67% win rate. Based on the trade performance so far, there is a 95% chance the expected win rate will be between 49% and 72%. (Stats as of 2022-10-28)","2022-10-31 Wrinkle-brain Plays (Mathematically derived options plays) # Tickers of Interest - TL;DR
