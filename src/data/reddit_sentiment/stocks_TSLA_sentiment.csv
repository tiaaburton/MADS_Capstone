0,TSLA,1669193217.0,TSLA to bounce from 2-year lows?,"Vehicle recalls, lockdowns in China, Elon Musk's acquisition and involvement in Twitter- a number of factors have contributed to the selling pressure Tesla has faced in recent weeks. But with the stock having fallen for 8 of the last 10 weeks and now trading at 2-year lows, is all the negative news is priced in? 

Despite briefly dipping below, TSLA did close above support coming from the August 2020 highs at 167.50. This level may have added significance from a technical standpoint, as the breakout in November 2020 is what took the stock into ""new-high"" territory. Buyers may therefore eye this level as a good area for accumulation which could help the stock form a base, or even begin a rebound if longer-term investors also look to add to their positions. 

Of course, all trading carries risk, and TSLA could continue to struggle as the fundamental backdrop for the company, as well as the broader market, remain relatively bearish.","TSLA to bounce from 2-year lows?

Reason why I'm asking this: While having a decent long-portfolio, I also have some stocks on my short-watchlist and every now and then when they have a green day, I like to go short on them or sell some bear spreads trying to collect some quick bucks. I usually close the position within one or two weeks.

**Currently on my short-list:**

* COIN/RIOT/MARA - they will have a hard time during crypto winter
* ZM - I think microsoft will eat away their business / covid is over
* trumps twitter clone - pretty high valuation for the product it has - might be risky once the ellection rally starts
* NTLA - burning money and Cathy Woods is bullish
* TSLA - still overvalued imo and elon going crazy.

# [Stock futures are slightly higher as investors look ahead to Fed meeting minutes](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/22/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures were marginally higher on Wednesday morning, as investors looked ahead to Federal Reserve meeting minutes for clues into the pace of future interest rate hikes.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures added 20 points points, or 0.1. S&P 500 futures also gained 0.1% along with Nasdaq 100 futures.
*****
> Shares of Nordstrom fell more than 8% in the premarket after the department store chain reaffirmed its forecast. However, Nordstrom beat profit and sales expectations in its latest results, according to consensus expectations on Refinitiv.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off an upbeat session, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging nearly 400 points Tuesday. The S&P 500 rose 1.36%, closing above the 4,000 level for the first time since September. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.36%.
*****
> Investors shrugged off fears of further lockdowns in China after the country reported its first Covid deaths since May. Instead, traders focused on some strong earnings reports, and bet on the likelihood for an easing in monetary policy from the Fed going forward.
*****
> “Investor psychology remaining optimistic is driving the rally in this market,” Eugene Profit, CEO at Profit Investments, said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
> “Going into the next Fed meeting, I think the Fed will probably moderate their language a little bit, and I think investors want to remain optimistic, and ignore a lot of headwinds in this market,” he added.
*****
> On the economic front, investors will review the latest Fed meeting minutes on Wednesday for insight into the central bank’s approach on monetary policy ahead of the December meeting.
*****
> Earlier in November, the central bank approved a fourth consecutive 0.75 percentage point hike that brought rates to their highest level since 2008. Economists are forecasting a half percentage point increase in December, and smaller rate hikes next year.
*****
> Additionally, investors will parse through the latest jobless claims data. Economists polled by Dow Jones are forecasting claims of 225,000 for the week ending Nov. 19, a slight increase from the 222,000 initial claims the prior week.
*****
> They’re also expecting the latest data on durable goods and new home sales in October. Durable goods in October are expected to have risen 0.5% from the prior month, according to estimates from Dow Jones.
*****
> Markets will be closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday and will close early on Friday.

5,TSLA,1668390923.0,I want peoples opinions on $TSLA,"*Short term noise*

$TSLA has fallen ~50% from ath mostly due to raising rates and all that shit but more recently the blue bird and Elon selling shares to feed the bird. 

The twitter purchase is annoying to me for 3 reasons. It takes away Elons time, its already cost a lot of $TSLA stock and he might end up selling more, and it’s causing uproar and extra downward pressure on the stock. But at the end of the day, it’s short term noise. Elon could sell all 420 million shares or whatever he owns and nothing would happen to Tesla the company longterm. 

Elon has been more erratic than usual lately, maybe it’s stress maybe he’s actually losing it. Maybe the power is going to his head, or it might just all be an act. Some of those are more likely than other of course, I’ll leave that there. Worst case Elon sells all his shares, tanking the stock and probably getting booted from the CEO spot. Idk if that’s actually how that works but regardless, Tesla would still be okay longterm. In my personal opinion, I think Elon is important to the company. I understand why some disagree, but that’s not what I’m debating here. 

*”DD”*

Tesla recently hit a PE of 56 with a forward PE of 35. Their last 3 quarters of earnings were $8.87b total, with a below average Q2 due to covid shutdowns in China. Q2 was only $2.26b in earnings, so if we assume tesla earns at least that (meaning negative growth Q/Q) 2022 will have earnings of $11.13b. 2021 and 2020 earnings were $5.52b and $721m. That will be another year of 100%+ earnings growth Y/Y. For reference the SP500 current and forward PE are ~19.5 and ~17, growth ~5-10%. 

So Tesla is growing and expected to grow earnings ~10x more than the SP500 but is only trading with a PE ~2x. This seems flawed to me. I have done screening and some comparison, but I’m sure some of you could say otherwise. 

Tesla is a car company, but it’s also much more. Not only are they leaders within the car industry they are outliers. VW CEO stated the model 3 is made 3x faster than their more efficient factory. The MIC vehicles are sold at ~30% margin, recently dropped to about ~27% to meet Chinese incentives. That’s ~20% higher than the industrial average *for ICE vehicles* which have higher margins than EV in general for legacy auto. In the US they are ~15% higher than the industry average. They have next to no debt, no dealership model, mobile service which depending on the state is very good or very bad but eventually it will be very good everywhere. If you look at Tesla without the name and not knowing what they sell they don’t look like a car maker. 

People love to talk about build quality. Clearly it’s not effecting sales but regardless it’s getting better and it’s actually good in China. And if you think this is a non fixable issues you’re delusional, it’s just not a priority. Cars are still selling, as soon as this changes it will become a priority. 

Cheap interior is cheap in cost, and far from “luxury” but it’s durable and practical. For $50k it’s understandable why not everyone loves it, and why some think it’s unacceptable. Not a real issue imo, if it starts reflecting in a loss of sales (after demand drops blow supply) they can easily add some leather and drop margins to make everyone happy again. I don’t see demand dropping below supply longterm anytime soon, especially with cheaper models being announced. 

Ford has only had earnings 1 of 3 quarters this year Q2 667m. Forward PE of 7.4, a mountain of debt, transitioning into a new manufacturing process while also scaling down another, low margins, but they are scaling EV production well. Aiming to hit 600k run-rate by 2023. 

VW has also put in serious work and has expanded quickly but their numbers are easy to get confused as they tend to combine hybrid and EV sales. They’re earnings have shrunk every quarter of this year. PE and forward of ~5. Selling 366k in the last 9 months, so we’ll assume 500k for the year and growth is ~25% Y/Y. 

Tesla can pay off debt with 1/4th of its cash on hand, has industry leading margins 15-20% higher than industry average, and are aiming to grow production at ~50% over the next couple years which they are on track to do. “Some years will be a little less some will be a little more.” Giga Shanghai, one of four Giga factories has a run-rate of 1 million alone. 

So the best US manufacturers are shrinking while Tesla is growing production and earnings at ~50% and ~100%. Yet Tesla is trading at ~5x industry av, remember what happened last time we saw economic downturn like this legacy did not do well. 

The economy is not doing great regardless of what the ice cream man says. Less people will be buying shit they don’t need, but generally luxury items perform better than regular consumer goods. The people that were stretching to afford a $50k+ car probably won’t be buying in these climates. But someone that had no issue buying will still be buying. Even if it’s worse than we thought and way less people are buying cars, who’s going to last longer, a shrinking non profitable legacy auto company or a small lean extremely profitable Tesla? Obviously tesla will perform better in those climates.

China is a threat to domination, not success. BYD has officially passed tesla in overall sales, and are doing extremely well. They’re moving into Europe, I don’t see them moving to North American markets soon. It’s very easy to do EVs in China thanks to the CCP, and they’re growing extremely fast due to soft regulations and a huge market. I think at least BYD will be a major player longterm and possibly NIO. I’d buy their stock if they weren’t IOUs from the CCP. 

I haven’t even touched on their energy business which is growing well and has a new factory ramping, I didn’t include  FSD because it’s not close to being solved but I strongly believe Tesla has set themselves up the best to do it, and I don’t consider the sex bot for multiple reasons. Regardless of not including them any one of these has the potential to be worth more than the car business. 

TLDR: Tesla has so much room to grow longterm, they’re an outlier and leader within the car industry with a forward PE of only 35 and earnings growth ~100% I strongly believe it has upside potential even in these market conditions.

Position 33.69 shares (ik I’m poor).","I want peoples opinions on $TSLA *Short term noise*

Q2 was only $2.26b in earnings, so if we assume tesla earns at least that (meaning negative growth Q/Q) 2022 will have earnings of $11.13b. 2021 and 2020 earnings were $5.52b and $721m. That will be another year of 100%+ earnings growth Y/Y. For reference the SP500 current and forward PE are ~19.5 and ~17, growth ~5-10%. 

So Tesla is growing and expected to grow earnings ~10x more than the SP500 but is only trading with a PE ~2x. This seems flawed to me. I have done screening and some comparison, but I’m sure some of you could say otherwise. 

Tesla is a car company, but it’s also much more. Not only are they leaders within the car industry they are outliers. VW CEO stated the model 3 is made 3x faster than their more efficient factory. The MIC vehicles are sold at ~30% margin, recently dropped to about ~27% to meet Chinese incentives. That’s ~20% higher than the industrial average *for ICE vehicles* which have higher margins than EV in general for legacy auto. In the US they are ~15% higher than the industry average. They have next to no debt, no dealership model, mobile service which depending on the state is very good or very bad but eventually it will be very good everywhere. If you look at Tesla without the name and not knowing what they sell they don’t look like a car maker. 

People love to talk about build quality. Clearly it’s not effecting sales but regardless it’s getting better and it’s actually good in China. And if you think this is a non fixable issues you’re delusional, it’s just not a priority. Cars are still selling, as soon as this changes it will become a priority. 

Cheap interior is cheap in cost, and far from “luxury” but it’s durable and practical. For $50k it’s understandable why not everyone loves it, and why some think it’s unacceptable. Not a real issue imo, if it starts reflecting in a loss of sales (after demand drops blow supply) they can easily add some leather and drop margins to make everyone happy again. I don’t see demand dropping below supply longterm anytime soon, especially with cheaper models being announced. 

Ford has only had earnings 1 of 3 quarters this year Q2 667m. Forward PE of 7.4, a mountain of debt, transitioning into a new manufacturing process while also scaling down another, low margins, but they are scaling EV production well. Aiming to hit 600k run-rate by 2023. 

VW has also put in serious work and has expanded quickly but their numbers are easy to get confused as they tend to combine hybrid and EV sales. They’re earnings have shrunk every quarter of this year. PE and forward of ~5. Selling 366k in the last 9 months, so we’ll assume 500k for the year and growth is ~25% Y/Y. 

Tesla can pay off debt with 1/4th of its cash on hand, has industry leading margins 15-20% higher than industry average, and are aiming to grow production at ~50% over the next couple years which they are on track to do. “Some years will be a little less some will be a little more.” Giga Shanghai, one of four Giga factories has a run-rate of 1 million alone. 

So the best US manufacturers are shrinking while Tesla is growing production and earnings at ~50% and ~100%. Yet Tesla is trading at ~5x industry av, remember what happened last time we saw economic downturn like this legacy did not do well. 

The economy is not doing great regardless of what the ice cream man says. Less people will be buying shit they don’t need, but generally luxury items perform better than regular consumer goods. The people that were stretching to afford a $50k+ car probably won’t be buying in these climates. But someone that had no issue buying will still be buying. Even if it’s worse than we thought and way less people are buying cars, who’s going to last longer, a shrinking non profitable legacy auto company or a small lean extremely profitable Tesla? Obviously tesla will perform better in those climates.

China is a threat to domination, not success. BYD has officially passed tesla in overall sales, and are doing extremely well. They’re moving into Europe, I don’t see them moving to North American markets soon. It’s very easy to do EVs in China thanks to the CCP, and they’re growing extremely fast due to soft regulations and a huge market. I think at least BYD will be a major player longterm and possibly NIO. I’d buy their stock if they weren’t IOUs from the CCP. 

I haven’t even touched on their energy business which is growing well and has a new factory ramping, I didn’t include  FSD because it’s not close to being solved but I strongly believe Tesla has set themselves up the best to do it, and I don’t consider the sex bot for multiple reasons. Regardless of not including them any one of these has the potential to be worth more than the car business. 

TLDR: Tesla has so much room to grow longterm, they’re an outlier and leader within the car industry with a forward PE of only 35 and earnings growth ~100% I strongly believe it has upside potential even in these market conditions.

Ok, there's already a lot that has been said about how negative Twitter has been to TSLA. But I think people are still undestimating just how much worse it can get.

Tesla investors are definitely pissed at this deal. One, it drives Elon's focus away from Tesla. Two, it forced Elon to sell TSLA. Three, if Twitter can't shore up its cash flow, Elon will likely have to keep selling TSLA to fund Twitter.

**Elon's erratic behavior is showing more than ever**

I used to think that Elon would make Twitter better. Now I'm not sure. His erratic behavior is showing up more than ever.

He cut half of the engineering staff, realized Twitter needed some fired engineers, while trying to cram untested monetization features into production. He's flip flopping on ideas within hours.

His ideas are half baked. For example, plenty of people got verified as [Lebron James, Trump, Nintendo, Jesus, etc.](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/9/23450289/twitter-impersonators-official-mario-musk-jesus-valve) The site is losing its credibility fast which will scare advertisers.

Users are also complaining about obvious bugs and issues. It's just the beginning.

Worse, people are seeing live how Elon builds products and it's probably scaring Tesla investors that this is how he does things: half baked ideas, empty promises, erratic.

**Twitter's debt repayment is huge and Elon will have to continue to sell TSLA to fund it**

Twitter's debt payments are around \~$1b/year according to some reports. Elon really needs Twitter to start turning the ship around fast and start becoming profitable. It looks like he's trying to throw anything at the wall to get Twitter to increase profits asap.

If advertisers continue to pull out, he's going to have continue to sell his TSLA shares.

He leveraged his Tesla shares to borrow to buy Twitter. If TSLA drops, he's going to have to provide more collateral or get margin called.

**Elon probably doesn't know how to run a social media company**

It's increasingly looking like Elon does not know how to run a social media company. For example, he's demanding changes based solely on his opinion instead of running A/B tests to quantify the change. As someone who ran a ton of A/B tests for a product similar to Twitter's, there can be a lot of unintended consequences when it comes to monetizations. IE. It looks like your change increased revenue by 3% but it drops total revenue by 5% after 2 months.

**tldr:** Musk desperately orders features in and out. Advertisers pull out or sit on the sidelines. Revenue falls. Musk tries even more desperate things. More advertisers leave.

With almost every stock hitting all-time-low, I wonder what's propping SPY up so far?

Let's take 13th Oct 2022 as the lowest so far @ $348. SPY is up 7.14% while the top 5 (worth 19% of SPY) is down 1.87%, the gap is 9%. So for the bottom 497 (503-6) stocks (81% weightage) to make up the missing 9%, they need to be collectively up by 11%.

Is my understanding of how SPY works and my math correct? If this is correct, which companies are gaining so much in the last 4 weeks (since 13th Oct 2022)?

Pardon me if I'm making a fool of myself if my understanding of the above is wrong, but that's how we learn! Thanks!

||% since 13th Oct 2022|SPY weightage|Contribution|

|SPY|\+7.14%|19.09% (SumOfTop5)|\-1.87% (SumOfTop5)|

18,TSLA,1667877227.0,why aren't people selling their tesla shares immediately?,"ig my question is p much self-explanatory. based on my (admittedly limited) understanding of what's gone down with twitter the value of tesla stocks are basically guaranteed to go down in the short term, as their current fall is going to necessitate musk putting down even more of his share and driving their value down further. in that case why don't investors just sell immediately and then buy their shares back once the situation cools down and twitter is either paid off or becomes insolvent? 

like even if you do have faith in the company you stand to make a little money by selling now and then buying back once the value bottoms out, right? ig i don't see much point in holding on to your share at this point in time- esp if $tsla is just going to bounce back later. I'm not an investor myself, so im curious as to what people who understand the stock market think of all this","why aren't people selling their tesla shares immediately? ig my question is p much self-explanatory. based on my (admittedly limited) understanding of what's gone down with twitter the value of tesla stocks are basically guaranteed to go down in the short term, as their current fall is going to necessitate musk putting down even more of his share and driving their value down further. in that case why don't investors just sell immediately and then buy their shares back once the situation cools down and twitter is either paid off or becomes insolvent?

19,TSLA,1667355242.0,"CNBC Pro ‘Very attractive’: Buy this automaker to play massive pent-up demand in U.S., fund manager says","There is huge demand for cars in both the U.S. and China -- the world’s two largest autos markets -- according to fund manager Steven Glass, who named one automaker to cash in. 

In the U.S. alone, the shortfall stands at five million vehicles, Glass, managing director and analyst at Pella Funds Management, told CNBC’s Street Signs Asia on Monday. “That’s pent-up demand for new vehicles in the U.S. alone, which we think we are going to start seeing next year as supply chains open up.”

Meanwhile, China is also starting to see growth in the autos market once more, after years of decline, according to Glass.

“China has just started to experience growth in its autos market. That market was in decline between 2018 and 2021, but now we have started seeing some growth again,” he added.

## How to play it

His top pick to play the sector is German automaker [BMW](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BMW-DE/).

Glass believes the company is likely to experience cyclical growth next year. It also has a “very well-managed” balance sheet and is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 5.5 — a 20-year low. 

Taken together, this makes the stock look “very, very attractive,” he said

BMW has long made clear its intention to challenge [Tesla’s](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) leadership in electric vehicles. The Bavarian automaker aims to have two million EVs on the roads by 2025 and estimates half of its car sales to comprise EVs by 2030.

Earlier this month, the company [announced plans to invest $1.7 billion](https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0404837EN/bmw-group-announces-1-7-billion-usd-investment-to-build-electric-vehicles-in-the-u-s-and-signs-agreement-with-envision-aesc-for-the-supply-of-battery-cells-to-plant-spartanburg?language=en) in its U.S. operations to build EVs and batteries.

Of this investment, $1 billion has been earmarked to prepare BMW’s existing U.S. manufacturing facility in South Carolina to produce EVs.

The German automaker expects to produce at least six [fully electric models](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/26/bmw-to-build-new-vehicle-at-south-carolina-plant.html) in the U.S. by 2030. 

**″**Going forward, \[the facility\] will also be a major driver for our electrification strategy, and we will produce at least six fully electric BMW X models here by 2030,” BMW Chairman Oliver Zipse said last month.

The remaining $700 million will be used for the construction of a new high-voltage battery assembly center. The company has already announced four additional battery cell factories that will be built in Europe and China to meet its demand for next-generation battery cells.

Shares in BMW are down 12.9% this year, outperforming Tesla, which has lost more than 40% of its market capitalization so far this year. The stock has an average potential upside of 20.6%, according to analyst estimates tracked by FactSet.","CNBC Pro ‘Very attractive’: Buy this automaker to play massive pent-up demand in U.S., fund manager says There is huge demand for cars in both the U.S. and China -- the world’s two largest autos markets -- according to fund manager Steven Glass, who named one automaker to cash in.
