0,TSLA,1669570652.0,TSLA CPO Inventory is getting flooded with cars each week,"Using [EV-CPO.com](https://EV-CPO.com), I've been tracking used Model 3 pricing primarily for my own research. I have parameters set for Clean title, under $45k, and under 30k miles. A month ago, a couple would pop up and get snagged very quickly. Since 11/8, average pricing has come down around 6%, but the amount of inventory has been doubling each week. 70 @ 11/17, 150 @ 11/22, 288 @ 11/27. It appears inventory is getting released but cars are just sitting likely because a base 2023 M3 (edit: Tesla Model 3) is $46k with only a couple week lead time. But whether it's Elon's antics tarnishing the brand, high interest rates, or hesitancy in spending, it seems like it's having an effect for sure.","TSLA CPO Inventory is getting flooded with cars each week Using [EV-CPO.com](https://EV-CPO.com), I've been tracking used Model 3 pricing primarily for my own research.

1,TSLA,1668036834.0,"Tesla Investors, what is your opinion of TSLA stock dropping due to Elon and Twitter?","I get that this Elon Twitter situation is a fiasco and Elon may have just made the worst trade in Modern history. BUT what do you feel about this current drop in Tesla stock? I feel that it’s just an emotional drop considering Twitter’s financials and Tesla’s are obviously separate. Besides Elon selling additional Tesla stock I don’t see any major negative catalysis besides increased competition but that is a developing issue. I could easily see the stock bouncing back once Elon stops talking about Twitter, what am I missing?","Tesla Investors, what is your opinion of TSLA stock dropping due to Elon and Twitter?

2,TSLA,1668135904.0,Does wash sale apply to gains,"Suppose I have a $1 million loss this year in stocks, so to offset it if I sell a stockB on which I am in $1 million profit, and immediately buy back stockB, can I show my total loss to 0, and new cost basis of stockB would be current price. is there any rule which can disallow that?

e.g. If I have substantial loss in META which I have already booked, and if I am holding TSLA since 5 years, can I sell TSLA to offset META loss, and buy it back?","Does wash sale apply to gains Suppose I have a $1 million loss this year in stocks, so to offset it if I sell a stockB on which I am in $1 million profit, and immediately buy back stockB, can I show my total loss to 0, and new cost basis of stockB would be current price. is there any rule which can disallow that?
