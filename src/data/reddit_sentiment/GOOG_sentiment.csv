4,GOOG,1668054361.0,What's propping SPY up?,"Hi,

With almost every stock hitting all-time-low, I wonder what's propping SPY up so far?

Let's take 13th Oct 2022 as the lowest so far @ $348. SPY is up 7.14% while the top 5 (worth 19% of SPY) is down 1.87%, the gap is 9%. So for the bottom 497 (503-6) stocks (81% weightage) to make up the missing 9%, they need to be collectively up by 11%.

Is my understanding of how SPY works and my math correct? If this is correct, which companies are gaining so much in the last 4 weeks (since 13th Oct 2022)?

Pardon me if I'm making a fool of myself if my understanding of the above is wrong, but that's how we learn! Thanks!

\[1\] - The adapter cracked but not melted. Card still works. I put it on the list for overabundance of caution

\[2\] - The quality of the image is low and doesn't seem to be any sign of melting but it seems there's some sign of discoloration. Card still works.

\[3\] - Based on the supplied images, the adapter does not seem to be melting but there's some thinning on the outer edge.

\[4\] - Based on the supplied image, this looks to be more of a physical damage vs thermal melting problem.

\[5\] - Based on the 2 supplied images, there seems to be a chipped damage on one of the pin as well as some sign of discoloration

* Just keeping everyone updated: Out of about 130 emails so far to the 4090cable inbox, we've received 7 that are 150V rated wires (and therefore potentially indicative of different supply), so 5%. That rating doesn't instantly mean it's bad. Replying to a few for info
* And to be really, really clear so people don't panic: Again, we have no evidence presently to suggest 150V cables are instantly bad. All that means is they're the same as what Igor showed - we assume older supply, but not sure. We're trying to get some for testing.
* The spec on the wire really just tells us that the supply is not the correct supply for that wire component. It's supposed to be 300V spec at 105C / 14AWG.
* Also, we're noticing a trend (could be limited sample size, not enough to know) of Zotac cards using this type of cable.
   * **Clarification**: Thanks, should have made it clearer with the vague reference. We don't know what Zotac is using at large. We know that most of the 7 150V ones we've received emails about are Zotac. I think 1-2 are Gigabyte.
* Oh, one other note - of the 130, not that many are actually burned. Still going through everything, but it's below 10 for sure. Several of the ones from reddit are not in our inbox, as they likely already had the cable replaced.

Summary:

* Igor's Labs cable showing 150v spec wire
* All 5x GN adapters show 300v 14AWG 105C on 12v/GND (28 AWG for sense lines)
* GN asked partners and manufacturers and the adapters are supposed to be like the 5 adapters GN has
* GN disagreed with Igor's analysis on the construction quality of the adapter based on the 5 adapters they have
* GN believes Igor's cable is a red herring and ultimately a ""different cable"" than what they own.
* GN noticed different soldering method between their cables and Igor's cable (larger/thicker 2 points on GN vs smaller/thinner 4 points on Igor's)
* GN cables do not snap as easily as Igor's
* \[Editor's Note\] GN is not saying Igor is wrong. GN is saying that Igor has a different adapter than what they own. Igor's conclusion comes from the adapter that he owns.
* **GN needs your help!!!**
   * **Email to:** [**4090cable@gamersnexus.net**](mailto:4090cable@gamersnexus.net)
   * **How to: Start with** [**Timestamp here**](https://youtu.be/EIKjZ1djp8c?t=720)
* Test Scenarios
   * GN tested 3 cards
   * Tested with 4 different cables
      * Stock
      * Uncut cable, bad contact
      * Both sides cut and bad contact
      * 1 side cut other side w/ bad contact
   * Plus Overclocked on each scenarios
* Most intense scenario is 8 hours full load with damaged cable
   * No damage even with this most intense scenario
* tldr conclusion:
   * There are enough failures to say that this is an issue. However, not every adapter has this issue.
   * GN needs your help!! Please watch the video starting at Timestamp above

**October 27, 2022 - The horror has a face – NVIDIA’s hot 12VHPWR adapter for the GeForce RTX 4090 with a built-in breaking point -** [**https://www.igorslab.de/en/adapter-of-the-gray-analyzed-nvidias-brand-hot-12vhpwr-adapter-with-built-in-breakpoint/**](https://www.igorslab.de/en/adapter-of-the-gray-analyzed-nvidias-brand-hot-12vhpwr-adapter-with-built-in-breakpoint/)

* The problem is not the 12VHPWR connection as such, nor the repeated plugging or unplugging.
* Standard compliant power supply cables from brand manufacturers are NOT affected by this so far.
* The current trigger is NVIDIA’s own adapter to 4x 8-pin in the accessories, whose inferior quality can lead to failures and has already caused damage in single cases.
* Splitting each of the four 14AWG leads onto each of the 6 pins in the 12VHPWR connector of the adapter by soldering them onto bridges that are much too thin is dangerous because the ends of the leads can break off at the solder joint (e.g., when kinked or bent several times).
* Bending or kinking the wires directly at the connector of the adapter puts too much pressure on the solder joints and bridges, so that they can break off.
* The inner bridge between the pins is too thin (resulting cross section) to compensate the current flow on two or three instead of four connected 12V lines.
* NVIDIA has already been informed in advance and the data and pictures were also provided by be quiet! directly to the R&amp;D department.

\[1\] - The adapter cracked but not melted. Card still works. I put it on the list for overabundance of caution

\[2\] - The quality of the image is low and doesn't seem to be any sign of melting but it seems there's some sign of discoloration. Card still works.

\[3\] - Based on the supplied images, the adapter does not seem to be melting but there's some thinning on the outer edge.

\[4\] - Based on the supplied image, this looks to be more of a physical damage vs thermal melting problem.

\[5\] - Based on the 2 supplied images, there seems to be a chipped damage on one of the pin as well as some sign of discoloration

* Just keeping everyone updated: Out of about 130 emails so far to the 4090cable inbox, we've received 7 that are 150V rated wires (and therefore potentially indicative of different supply), so 5%. That rating doesn't instantly mean it's bad. Replying to a few for info
* And to be really, really clear so people don't panic: Again, we have no evidence presently to suggest 150V cables are instantly bad. All that means is they're the same as what Igor showed - we assume older supply, but not sure. We're trying to get some for testing.
* The spec on the wire really just tells us that the supply is not the correct supply for that wire component. It's supposed to be 300V spec at 105C / 14AWG.
* Also, we're noticing a trend (could be limited sample size, not enough to know) of Zotac cards using this type of cable.
   * **Clarification**: Thanks, should have made it clearer with the vague reference. We don't know what Zotac is using at large. We know that most of the 7 150V ones we've received emails about are Zotac. I think 1-2 are Gigabyte.
* Oh, one other note - of the 130, not that many are actually burned. Still going through everything, but it's below 10 for sure. Several of the ones from reddit are not in our inbox, as they likely already had the cable replaced.

Summary:

* Igor's Labs cable showing 150v spec wire
* All 5x GN adapters show 300v 14AWG 105C on 12v/GND (28 AWG for sense lines)
* GN asked partners and manufacturers and the adapters are supposed to be like the 5 adapters GN has
* GN disagreed with Igor's analysis on the construction quality of the adapter based on the 5 adapters they have
* GN believes Igor's cable is a red herring and ultimately a ""different cable"" than what they own.
* GN noticed different soldering method between their cables and Igor's cable (larger/thicker 2 points on GN vs smaller/thinner 4 points on Igor's)
* GN cables do not snap as easily as Igor's
* \[Editor's Note\] GN is not saying Igor is wrong. GN is saying that Igor has a different adapter than what they own. Igor's conclusion comes from the adapter that he owns.
* **GN needs your help!!!**

   * **How to: Start with** [**Timestamp here**](https://youtu.be/EIKjZ1djp8c?t=720)
* Test Scenarios
   * GN tested 3 cards
   * Tested with 4 different cables
      * Stock
      * Uncut cable, bad contact
      * Both sides cut and bad contact
      * 1 side cut other side w/ bad contact
   * Plus Overclocked on each scenarios
* Most intense scenario is 8 hours full load with damaged cable
   * No damage even with this most intense scenario
* tldr conclusion:
   * There are enough failures to say that this is an issue. However, not every adapter has this issue.
   * GN needs your help!! Please watch the video starting at Timestamp above

**October 27, 2022 - The horror has a face – NVIDIA’s hot 12VHPWR adapter for the GeForce RTX 4090 with a built-in breaking point -** [**https://www.igorslab.de/en/adapter-of-the-gray-analyzed-nvidias-brand-hot-12vhpwr-adapter-with-built-in-breakpoint/**](https://www.igorslab.de/en/adapter-of-the-gray-analyzed-nvidias-brand-hot-12vhpwr-adapter-with-built-in-breakpoint/)

* The problem is not the 12VHPWR connection as such, nor the repeated plugging or unplugging.
* Standard compliant power supply cables from brand manufacturers are NOT affected by this so far.
* The current trigger is NVIDIA’s own adapter to 4x 8-pin in the accessories, whose inferior quality can lead to failures and has already caused damage in single cases.
* Splitting each of the four 14AWG leads onto each of the 6 pins in the 12VHPWR connector of the adapter by soldering them onto bridges that are much too thin is dangerous because the ends of the leads can break off at the solder joint (e.g., when kinked or bent several times).
* Bending or kinking the wires directly at the connector of the adapter puts too much pressure on the solder joints and bridges, so that they can break off.
* The inner bridge between the pins is too thin (resulting cross section) to compensate the current flow on two or three instead of four connected 12V lines.
* NVIDIA has already been informed in advance and the data and pictures were also provided by be quiet! directly to the R&amp;D department.

In after hours it even drops 20%, taking to the prices it traded in January 2016. According to data from GuruFocus, the company is considered significantly undervalued as can be seen from the graph below.

In general, growth companies at this time suffer greatly from both a lack of liquidity and the fact that they are priced in relation to future cash flows.

With bond yields skyrocketing, it's more profitable to pocket the coupon of a bond than invest in a stock that hardly pays dividends.

In after hours it even drops 20%, taking to the prices it traded in January 2016. According to data from GuruFocus, the company is considered significantly undervalued as can be seen from the graph below.

In general, growth companies at this time suffer greatly from both a lack of liquidity and the fact that they are priced in relation to future cash flows.

With bond yields skyrocketing, it's more profitable to pocket the coupon of a bond than invest in a stock that hardly pays dividends. 

On the macro front, GDP data will be released today: hopefully the umpteenth bad news is that the GDP is worse than expected to avoid further tightening by the FED.

30,GOOG,1666790253.0,FAANG + Microsoft are still a genuinely attractive buy to me,"Long story short I’m finding these 6 stocks to be very attractive currently for the following reasons: 

1. Generating monstrous free cash flow each with their own future potential growth areas. All of these companies have proven highly innovative with very solid managements, especially AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, and MSFT, who are sort of in their own little tier.

2. Still have massive user bases, pricing power and most of us use their services daily. This is really the crux of the appeal to me. I don’t get how people compare these to Pets.com or even Yahoo. From what I see, they’re practically inescapable and on avg each person reading this thread probably contributes hundreds of dollars to each of their top lines yearly, either directly or indirectly.

3. For the ones that are less “gold plated” when it comes to the core of their business aka Meta and Netflix, they are currently trading at much much saner multiples than before, especially Meta, and still are solid businesses with moats and tons of FCF. 

I feel Netflix still offers the best service amongst the streaming platforms and is an innovative enough company to maintain its profitability and growth. It also has streaming as its core bread and butter business unlike AMZN and arguably Disney. 

Re: Meta, Metaverse may look like a weird bet but the VR/AR tech they’re investing in is absolutely industry leading and FB ads still have a massive moat in digital advertising thanks to Insta. Current valuation is a bargain when you consider their profits and growth. 

Hence, I feel there’s a decent rational logic to buying these stocks over the next year or so keeping a 10 year + horizon in mind. They might get killed over the next 1-2-3 whatever years but I find them to offer solid and reliable value.

31,GOOG,1666822917.0,"10-26-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market Analysis","Well today was one wild day that’s for sure. From the $3 green candle at 10am in less than one minute to the followed up $4 drop over 2 hours this day was full of volatility and extreme hard technical to trade. I actually only made four scalps today which is extreme low for me considering most days I make 8-10. However, with the movement of SPY, Tesla and Apple today I was able to make some successful level to level plays. Thankfully even when stocks are moving irrationally they still have a way of respecting the overall TA and key levels. 

I have had a LOT of questions about what a “level to level” play is so im going to post an example of what I call out and then I will explain what it is and why I play it to clear up the confusion. I have started to play a lot more of these as the charts respect the technical better and this allows everyone to get in on the play when its hard for everyone to eat on scalps. Also theta has been eating extra good lately and after the first 15minutes we have had such choppy movements but have been making larger overall plays that a longer dte from level to level has been able to overcome those negatives. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hy9itsil68w91.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea756099c1fb1e847b6a6bbc748dc30117732cad

Okay this morning at open I called out this play on Tesla. You can see in the below picture that was the daily chart. What I had seen that despite MSFT and GOOG missing and dumping and even SPY was very red at open we had a pretty bullish open. We had held over 215 support overnight and we had held the daily 8ema support at open. This was a sign of bullishness and the 15min chart was looking bullish along with the DMI stoch. We were at a key level having broken over 223 resistance at the time of call out. 

The way a LEVEL TO LEVEL play as I call it works is that we are finding a major resistance that was turned into support. So Tesla had broken through previous 223 resistance. We now look for the next major resistance which at the time would have been 230 followed by 234. This will be our take profit target. We then look for a key support that if that breaks would signal down side. The trick to this it to find a soft enough support that you aren’t stopping out too soon (this is why I didn’t chose 223 because a back test could have occurred) but we are not having such a far away support that by time it hits our position is extreme red. We are eyeing a support and also a DTE that gives us room to be right and win but also gives us room to be wrong and avoid theta without ending up overly red. 

I played this breakout with a 2dte call for 50% then followed it up with a 30% 2dte win and a 9dte 26% win using this. The 2dtes went on to well over 100% and the 9dte hit 50% plus when I had looked before it reached my target of 230. 

Now you noticed my target was 230 however I had sold early when it had stopped at an intraday resistance. The key here is that while we fully expect it to hit the take profit once we have secured a large enough profit and the overall momentum appears to have slowed down we take profits and secure our win. This is not a diamond hand be greedy play. Essentially we are playing a longer DTE and bigger move from level to level (or support to resistance/ resistance to support). Hope that explains that better!

Key support- 381.6 -> 378.9 -> 378 -> 374.3

Key resistance- 385 -> 388.6 -> 390.1

I am bearish short term on Spy. I had mentioned last week and this week that my initial thoughts if we broke through 378.2 was that we could touch that 388.5 to 390 range. We fell just short of that today. With the massive green candle being put in followed by this impressive gravestone doji with this really tight rising wedge inside the red bear channel I am expecting a retrace and retest of support down near 378.2 to 378.8 tomorrow. Now I am not sure if that support will hold or if we are going to see a drill. With MSFT, GOOG and now META getting wrecked on earnings really everything relies on Apple…. And let me tell you APPLE got wrecked intraday today relatively speaking.

Something else to keep in mind for tomorrow is that GDP and jobs release at 830am. Overall today if you noticed that huge red dump that came out of no where it was directly correlated to the time the Atlanta Fed updated its GDP forecast to be even higher then expected. Wait but why is a good GDP bad? Well in the simplest of terms if the GDP is good that means the economy is still strong and means we are out of the technical recession that we were never technically in (lol yeah it be like that). So this means the FED could realistically be even more hawkish thinking inflation is not going to slow enough.

You know those little maps that say “you are here” when you are lost at the mall? Well this is your guide right here on futures. I believe we could be seeing a similar movement, rejection with a doji followed by a sell off (data/ macro driven) after a bear market rally just like we saw back in the first week of October. 

As you can see on Futures we are in a similar rising wedge pattern inside of a bull channel that should result in a pullback. Important think to note is that Futures attempted to break through that blue dotted bear channel resistance (this is the resistance that dates back to the august 4300 peak… apple and spy have broken theirs but futures have not). I actually had an upside target today of 3925 and we looked like we were going to fully test that bear channel resistance but were smacked down hard by that GDP news and never was able to recover… its almost like markets for the last week have forgotten the full macro bear picture and were promptly reminded today. 

Key support- 3840 -> 3805 -> 3770

Key resistance- 3875 -> 3925

That rising wedge I reference on SPY and futures today well Apple had that formed already and we saw that support fail today. With that support failing today we are going to be looking for a true test of this red bull channel support tomorrow. This will also bring a test of the daily 8ema and possibly the daily 20ema. With earnings reporting tomorrow night after hours we should see the sentiment be priced in during the day tomorrow. Todays price action on Apple looked like someone knew something and that something wasn’t very bullish… 

With MSFT, GOOG, and META now all missing… technically Tesla beat but missed revenue… its really left up to Apple and Amazon tomorrow. Apple has put the market on its back once before… But overall I would be shocked to see Amazon beat. I really don’t know if Apple does or not. My thoughts are they have had a lot of slow downs and stuff but im not sure if we see the total effect this quarter or next quarter. 

Key support- 149.3 -> 147.3 -> 145.5

Key resistance- 150.9 -> 152.4

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fo4v4uko68w91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=cae8d6b2d072cf760081166a815be378b969eb3a

Who loves a busy chart? Lol well lets take a look here lots to breakdown on Tesla today… So we actually broke out of the red/ blue diamond. This means I would expect further upside from Tesla. However, as you can see we hard rejected the daily 20ema on the breakout today. Usually the 20ema is about the last resort before we see a bearish move. Its either breakout or breakdown at the daily 20ema. However, we are holding the daily 8ema and we are also see a pretty intense black rising wedge and there is actually another rising wedge formed with the red bull channel and the black 3 day support line. 

Overall unless Tesla open over 225 tomorrow we break through support of this rising wedge and that should open up some downside. If we open under 225 tomorrow I will be looking for a retest of the daily 8ema and 219.3 support. Once we lose 219.3 I fully expect a move back to 215. 

Something I have noticed is that Tesla really has formed a nice sideways channel from about 205 to 225. It seems the closer we get to 225 we reject and drop and anything near 205 is a call opportunity. I will look for this to play out tomorrow and consider some puts at open on Tesla. 

Key support- 219.3 -> 214.4 -> 209.9 -> 205.6

Key resistance- 225 -> 229.5 -> 234

As if the VIX couldn’t become anymore detached from reality… we have SPY rip from -1% to green and back to -.75% and the VIX did what? It actually unwound more. Makes 100% sense right? 

Well I do have a theory on this. Todays price action if you watched it intraday was absolutely bonkers… however, my thoughts about the price action was that we were seeing OTM puts be unwound today. I think people had hedged so aggressively bearish for CPI and with this rally I feel that perhaps (and this is just a theory) that people finally accepted the feds gonna slow hikes in December narrative and before FOMC next week people wanted to drop those puts. That’s really the only explanation I have as to why we would see the VIX unwind so much when on a red day like this. Outside of that besides the VIX is detached from reality I have nothing for you. 

10% challenge- 

As I explained on my level to level plays at the top today was a tough day to trade. Seemed like things were so beyond erratic I just played some safer level to level longer DTE plays with tight stops and tight take profits.

I had mentioned how I really thought FORD, and META would miss bigly on earnings. I was beyond right on META. I hadn’t planned to play it but figured last second why not since ive had a great week and it’s a small position.. but I also grabbed a SPX put for tomorrow for the GDP reading. I actually am a little surprised to see Futures green after hours after the META miss. I would have expected a more negative reaction overall market wise. But with GDP and jobs tomorrow I do expect a reaction there.

As I explained on my level to level plays at the top today was a tough day to trade. Seemed like things were so beyond erratic I just played some safer level to level longer DTE plays with tight stops and tight take profits.

I had mentioned how I really thought FORD, and META would miss bigly on earnings. I was beyond right on META. I hadn’t planned to play it but figured last second why not since ive had a great week and it’s a small position.. but I also grabbed a SPX put for tomorrow for the GDP reading. I actually am a little surprised to see Futures green after hours after the META miss. I would have expected a more negative reaction overall market wise. But with GDP and jobs tomorrow I do expect a reaction there.

Wish me luck…. Im hoping im not remind why I don’t do overnight swings and why I don’t play earnings at open tomorrow….

1. Generating monstrous free cash flow each with their own future potential growth areas. All of these companies have proven highly innovative with very solid managements, especially AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, and MSFT, who are sort of in their own little tier.

2. Still have massive user bases, pricing power and most of us use their services daily. This is really the crux of the appeal to me. I don’t get how people compare these to Pets.com or even Yahoo.

3. For the ones that are less “gold plated” when it comes to the core of their business aka Meta and Netflix, they are currently trading at much much saner multiples than before, especially Meta, and still are solid businesses with moats and tons of FCF.

>It's no surprise that all the drama in the world's largest bond market would dictate sentiment at a time when traders have been obsessed with the outlook for interest rates. After being all over the place in early trading, stocks rose sharply as bond yields fell from multiyear highs.

>The next step in the US central bank's anti-inflation campaign will be to debate how high to raise interest rates and when to slow the pace of increases. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and his San Francisco counterpart Mary Daly both stated that they expect the discussion to be on the table at the November meeting, while emphasizing the importance of continuing to tighten.

If we can trade out of this smaller rectangle -highlighted in blue, I believe that we will see 380 and then decide from there. It’s do or die here IMO as GOOG, AAPL, MSFT, META, and AMZN report next week. Beats and FED talk about pivoting could give us the Nov. midterm rally to 390 - 400+.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

>Another day of big reversals on Wall Street, with stocks posting their best week since June after a treasury rout stalled. The yen rose after reports that Japan may have intervened once more to support the currency.  
>  
>It's no surprise that all the drama in the world's largest bond market would dictate sentiment at a time when traders have been obsessed with the outlook for interest rates. After being all over the place in early trading, stocks rose sharply as bond yields fell from multiyear highs.  
>  
>The next step in the US central bank's anti-inflation campaign will be to debate how high to raise interest rates and when to slow the pace of increases. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard and his San Francisco counterpart Mary Daly both stated that they expect the discussion to be on the table at the November meeting, while emphasizing the importance of continuing to tighten.

Bulls closed well above the 20 MA. The 20 MA currently sits at 366.00. It’s important for bulls to follow through. If we can trade out of this smaller rectangle -highlighted in blue, I believe that we will see 380 and then decide from there. It’s do or die here IMO as GOOG, AAPL, MSFT, META, and AMZN report next week. Beats and FED talk about pivoting could give us the Nov. midterm rally to 390 - 400+.

45,GOOG,1666114934.0,Facebook Parent Meta Ordered to Sell Giphy After Losing Fight in U.K.,"Facebook META -0.11%▼ owner Meta Platforms Inc. META -0.25%▼ said it would sell its social-media animated-images company Giphy after the U.K.’s top competition authority affirmed an earlier order to undo the 2020 acquisition.

Facebook’s announcement all but ends a yearslong saga in which a foreign regulator made a rare intervention in an already-consummated deal between two American companies. British regulators had ordered Meta to operate Giphy separately while the deal was under review.

Meta, then known as Facebook, bought Giphy in May 2020 for $315 million. The company, with offices in New York City and Los Angeles, allows users to search for, create and share short animated videos, or GIFs, which have become popular in social-media posts, texts and other communications.

The U.K.’s Competition and Markets Authority initially ordered Meta to sell Giphy last year. Meta appealed the decision. In July, the Competition Appeal Tribunal backed the CMA in five out of six challenges to the CMA ruling. On Tuesday, after taking that ruling into consideration, the CMA issued a revised decision that again ordered Meta to sell Giphy.

Meta said it is disappointed by the order, but it won’t appeal the decision further. The company said it would work with the CMA to sell Giphy and is awaiting more details in the coming weeks from the regulator about how it should do so.

The decision comes as the CMA is asserting itself on the global stage as a technology regulator—opening antitrust cases against tech companies alongside others stemming from the U.S. and European Union. The CMA has open cases looking at issues including how Alphabet Inc.’s GOOG 0.91%▲ Google brokers ads on third-party websites, and the control that the regulator says Apple Inc. and Google exercise over mobile-phone software. The companies say they comply with competition rules and are working with the regulator.

Meta’s acquisition of Giphy “would significantly reduce competition in two markets,” said Stuart McIntosh, chairman of the investigative team appointed by the CMA to review the deal. By buying Giphy, Mr. McIntosh said Facebook had removed a “potential challenger in the U.K. display ad market, while also giving Meta the ability to further increase its substantial market power in social media.” A sale of Giphy is the only way to address the issue, he said.

Meta had said in the past that consumers and Giphy are better off with the infrastructure and resources Meta can provide. The company said at the time of the deal that it would integrate Giphy into its Instagram platform.

The CMA began probing Meta’s Giphy deal soon after it was announced. Last fall, it fined Meta 50.5 million pounds, equivalent to $57.2 million, saying the company had failed to provide required updates outlining its compliance with the initial enforcement order in relation to the merger review. Meta at the time disputed the fine for what the company called a “best effort compliance approach.”

The move by the CMA isn’t an unprecedented one. In April 2020, it blocked Sabre Corp.’s tie-up with rival travel booking service Farelogix Inc., saying it was anticompetitive. The regulator said the deal could have reduced innovation in the sector and led to higher fees for certain products.

The top watchdog of American business is also home to Washington’s most active Wall Street investors.

The Federal Trade Commission in recent years has opened investigations into nearly every major industry. It has launched antitrust probes into technology companies, examined credit card firms and moved to restrict drug, energy and defense-company mergers.

At the same time, senior officials at the FTC disclosed more trades of stocks, bonds and funds, on average, than officials at any other major agency in [a Wall Street Journal review of financial disclosures at 50 federal agencies ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-officials-invest-in-companies-their-agencies-oversee-11665489653?mod=article_inline)from 2016 to 2021.

Many of the investments overlapped with the FTC’s work.

A third of its 90 senior officials owned or traded stock in companies that were undergoing an FTC merger review or investigation, based on actions the agency has made public.

FTC officials owned stock in 22 of the roughly 60 large companies the FTC brought cases against in the period reviewed.

The officials were most heavily invested in technology, an industry that has come under increasing scrutiny by the agency.
