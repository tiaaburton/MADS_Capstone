0,GOOG,1669690047.0,Regarding the most feasible education investment option for my kids,"Dear Folks,

I moved to the states a couple of years back and have 2 kids. 

They are 8 & 14 yo now, one goes to 8th grade and another is in 2nd grade in public schools.

About my Income: I make 130k base/yr + 12k annual bonus, I save 15% of my base into 401k (close to 90k now) and 10% goes to ESPP (just started last month). After taxes + Insurance + ESPP cuts, I am left up with around 5k and my expenses are 4k-4.5k/month (rent itself is 2.2k) so there will be leftovers for $500 to 1k USD every month.

I just started putting $500 in my elder ones UTMA account and thinking of buying Dividend stocks e.g. JEPI / BST / SCHD etc but I am open to suggestions and If I shouldn't invest that amount at all as tenure is short. I also have 529s which are not mentioned below, they also have 1k each for both of them but they are not growing at all so I am not sure if it's wise to put $ in them now.

I've saved the following so far for them:
