8,TSLA,1668061420.0,Opinion: People are still underestimating Twitter's risk on TSLA,"Ok, there's already a lot that has been said about how negative Twitter has been to TSLA. But I think people are still undestimating just how much worse it can get.

Tesla investors are definitely pissed at this deal. One, it drives Elon's focus away from Tesla. Two, it forced Elon to sell TSLA. Three, if Twitter can't shore up its cash flow, Elon will likely have to keep selling TSLA to fund Twitter.

**Elon's erratic behavior is showing more than ever**

I used to think that Elon would make Twitter better. Now I'm not sure. His erratic behavior is showing up more than ever.

He cut half of the engineering staff, realized Twitter needed some fired engineers, while trying to cram untested monetization features into production. He's flip flopping on ideas within hours.

His ideas are half baked. For example, plenty of people got verified as [Lebron James, Trump, Nintendo, Jesus, etc.](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/9/23450289/twitter-impersonators-official-mario-musk-jesus-valve) The site is losing its credibility fast which will scare advertisers.

Users are also complaining about obvious bugs and issues. It's just the beginning.

Worse, people are seeing live how Elon builds products and it's probably scaring Tesla investors that this is how he does things: half baked ideas, empty promises, erratic.

**Twitter's debt repayment is huge and Elon will have to continue to sell TSLA to fund it**

Twitter's debt payments are around \~$1b/year according to some reports. Elon really needs Twitter to start turning the ship around fast and start becoming profitable. It looks like he's trying to throw anything at the wall to get Twitter to increase profits asap.

If advertisers continue to pull out, he's going to have continue to sell his TSLA shares.

He leveraged his Tesla shares to borrow to buy Twitter. If TSLA drops, he's going to have to provide more collateral or get margin called.

**Elon probably doesn't know how to run a social media company**

It's increasingly looking like Elon does not know how to run a social media company. For example, he's demanding changes based solely on his opinion instead of running A/B tests to quantify the change. As someone who ran a ton of A/B tests for a product similar to Twitter's, there can be a lot of unintended consequences when it comes to monetizations. IE. It looks like your change increased revenue by 3% but it drops total revenue by 5% after 2 months.

**tldr:** Musk desperately orders features in and out. Advertisers pull out or sit on the sidelines. Revenue falls. Musk tries even more desperate things. More advertisers leave. Musk needs to sell more TSLA to fund Twitter experiment.","Opinion: People are still underestimating Twitter's risk on TSLA Ok, there's already a lot that has been said about how negative Twitter has been to TSLA.

9,TSLA,1668003454.0,Insider Trading Weekly Update #013: Largest Trades + Sector and Market Cap Overviews + Note on Elon Dumping TSLA Shares,"# Good morning,

**TL;DR** total purchases and sales are down \~30% from the past week, while total participants are up at least 75%. Another 279 insiders filed Form 4s, bringing the total filing to 622.

A quick note on Elon - the sales are not represented here **\*yet\*** since they are **Indirect** trades and the reports only included **Direct** purchases and sales. **Indirect trades will be added moving forward.**

# High-Level Stats:

* Purchases decreased from $76.5M to $53.7M (-30%)
* Sales decreased from $1.1B to $740M (-31%)
* Transactions increased from 383 to 679 (+77%)
* Companies represented in Form 4s increased from 225 to 394 (+75%)
   * Net buyers increased from 25 to 49 (+96%)
   * Net sellers increased from 200 to 345 (+73%)
* Insiders filing Form 4s increased from 343 to 622 (+81%)
   * Net buyers increased from 45 to 108 (+140%)
   * Net sellers increased from 298 to 514 (+72%)

# Transaction Selection

1. **All** **Direct Open Market Transactions** from **October 31st - November 4th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of “P” or “S”. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.
2. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **October 24th - October 28th.**
3. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income/mutual funds).

# Further Context

1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\*roughly\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.
2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\*if\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.
3. Data is sourced by algos behind [Form Fore](http://formfore.io/)

As always, appreciate any feedback that you have on the reports, stats, etc.

I’m only a year old member of the page, but thought i’d share my thoughts because while this page is fun, it can also be toxic at times and not overly helpful or insightful. That being said, there are plenty of times I have seen positivity and  insight. I’m not a professional at this at all, but thought i’d share my thoughts after my first year of trading options…. But first here was my trade today:

I took a short position (bought puts) on TSLA towards the top of its 207-226 channel this morning. Took 2 contacts at 220ish. 1 additional contract at 223ish. I had my stop loss set, and then went to my actual job. The thesis was that it would get back to 207 support in short to mid term.


 I obviously got very lucky that TSLA severely underperformed today and happened to hit my target. I’ve always hung on to losers too long and winners too short, so i was sure to move my stop to break even when it moved my way, and then continually moved my stop up as the trade worked in my favor. Eventually got stopped out around 206 for $1,710. Felt nice because the risk reward was there, and everything made sense, obviously lucky that TSLA was weak with twitter debacle, but nice to have one go my way.


I’m now long two contracts as you can see above. Thesis is TSLA will return to 220s and stay within this channel in short to mid term. If i get stopped out monday, so be it, but the risk reward for me makes sense.


Things i’ve learned the last year: 


1. I can’t trade 0dte contracts. It’s straight gambling for me and i suck at that. I’m also too busy with my actual job to monitor trades like these which i assume require a high level of attention to detail. 3-4 Weeks minimum preferred for me.


2. The trade has to have a clear out front thesis that doesn’t evolve to fit your bias as the trade plays out.

3. Position sizing is so important for my financial and mental well being. I have to be sure to never risk more than a certain percentage of my portfolio. “Preserve precious capital” as a famous trader says makes sense to me


4. The better my mental and physical health the clearer my mind is with trading.


5. Mistakes happen. Basically blew up my account last fall when beginning options and while i hated myself, it taught me a lot about myself, and my tendencies.

6. I prefer to stick with one stock and listen to a few youtubers i like that analyze it. Simple things like supply and demand level, rsi and macd, and paying attention to fed news and the indices.

I’m not an OG here, but thought i’d share my thoughts and a positive trade i made as i continue to grow and improve. Maybe the mods will remove, idk. TGIF


TLDR: i have learned the hard way about risk management, having a real thesis before trades, and avoiding theta decay/ giving myself time on trades by picking better (in my opinion) expiration dates. Also, if i can’t sleep or feel anxious after the closing bell, i know i am not sizing properly and over risking …

Be safe, enjoy your weekend, momentum is real and let it start rolling in the right direction 😀","TGIF: TSLA gain (not the minimum required for me to tag gain, but here are some of my thoughts).

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is selling millions of Tesla shares again. The celebrity executive disposed of 19.5 million shares Tuesday, which is worth about $3.95 billion, according to three filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Musk did not take to Twitter to explain why he sold shares, but it’s possible the money will go towards his $44 billion deal to buy the social media platform, which went through last month.

In April, Musk also sold around 9.6 million shares of Tesla stock, which at the time was worth $8.5 billion. Those shares were sold at around $885.42. Since then, Tesla has issued a three-for-one stock split, bringing the cost of each share down.

Musk sold shares Tuesday at an average price of $202.56 each.

Tesla is currently trading at $191.30 after hours.

I'm 37. Asian male. Single. Ex-SWE

During the peak of the 2021, I became a millionaire. I went all in with my 300k on TSLA in beginning of 2020, and it ended up shoot up to 1.5mil at the peak. Overnight, I became a millionaire without doing much other than clicking a few things in my browser. That gave me confidence. That gave me thinking that I am the shit. I quit my job since I actually never liked SWE, and said I'm gonna do my on thing. I started dabbling in C and put majority of my winnings there.

Then it dropped by 60% during the recent crashes. I still had around 400k in C, and I basically stopped trading at a point and put all of that into USDC. Only that it was all in FTX and now I can't draw them out.

I don't know what's gonna happen, but right now I'm sitting at 10k liquid in my bank. I thought I was a confidence millionaire, and all the sudden things went upside down.

This is scary. All the sudden, things just went to 0. Everything I had worked for suddenly came crumbling down.

So I went from being a confident millionaire to a terrified crybaby. I don't know what's gonna happen, but this is where I am now.

Everything -- gone, just like that.

I wanna say im fine, but its slowly settling in on me.

But someone dawned on me. A realization. An epiphany.

The way I had been going with my life is entirely backwards. I viewed money as important, but in the end it isn't. When I became a millionaire, I thought it'd be world changing. It isn't. I wasn't any different, but having the lottery money gave me some confidence, and I ran with it. But now, gone with the crashes of 2022. I'm now jobless, savingless, and the prospects for finding a SWE job seems daunting amongst layoffs.

It just showed me how wrong I've been living life. Completely backwards. I never liked SWE and just did it for the money. With that money I invested into stocks and C, and did well. With that money, I upgrade my life, my tastes, etc. But deep down I wasn't happy nor fulfilled.

This all made me realize that I've been building my life on sand, and it's all been an illusion. Money, better life, upgrades, all these external things are just an illusion. Why was I chasing after all these? How did I end up in this mess?

And, for the first time in a long time, I prayed. Surrendering myself, and prayed.

And strangely enough, I don't feel so bad anymore.

All these external things -- chasing after money, luxury, materialism -- really don't mean much anymore. These are the wrong metrics to evaluate my life. And letting these go, freed me from the weight of thinking about them.

From now, the metric I go by is how much I am helping others with my heart and skills. Doing this really makes me feel fulfilled.

I have recently been dabbling with creators, and I completed a writing cohort and I've been helping out here and there. I feel very alive and fulfilled doing so.

So now I want to measure myself by how much I am helping others, building the **social credit or goodwill**, as the currency. I am going to give more than I take. I'm letting go of the obsession w/ money, and instead of focusing on helping ppl with my unique talents.

I am not scared of my future, because I know this new path is a more fulfilling one to embark on.

With almost every stock hitting all-time-low, I wonder what's propping SPY up so far?

Let's take 13th Oct 2022 as the lowest so far @ $348. SPY is up 7.14% while the top 5 (worth 19% of SPY) is down 1.87%, the gap is 9%. So for the bottom 497 (503-6) stocks (81% weightage) to make up the missing 9%, they need to be collectively up by 11%.

Is my understanding of how SPY works and my math correct? If this is correct, which companies are gaining so much in the last 4 weeks (since 13th Oct 2022)?

Pardon me if I'm making a fool of myself if my understanding of the above is wrong, but that's how we learn! Thanks!

- Elon does not own above 50% of Tesla. 


- Elon can be fired from Tesla. 


- Elon is the main reason for TSLA shares to trade so high.


Question is, is it worth keeping him? 


If we solely think of stock performance as a sign of success and well being of a company, Elon can be considered a huge asset. Absurd price of the stock even today is only due to him being the CEO... well sort of was. The sentiment is quickly changing. 


IMO Elon's job at TESLA is done. The company is sustainable and cannot be outdone by other companies in the global market. Though competition in the Chinese market is too hot for any real benefit in the long run. 


In the recent earning report many people were pointing out how margins are falling and inventory was going up. 


These are products of high inflation and rising cost of materials. It's nothing out of the ordinary. The fact that the company is still able to grow is what you want to see in this economic climate. 


Toyota's lean inventory management was successful in the last 20 years due to stable commodity markets and a very efficient worldwide shipping network. Today these are both high affected by the pandemic and high inflation. To make it simpler for smooth brains. Cost of storing inventory may be lower than paying more for inventory every month due to highly volatile raw materials. Higher inventory is a sign of preparedness which I welcome.


IMO Tesla is here to stay and will still come out on top after the dust settles. 


But is TSLA a $200 - $300 stock? Not even close. I think it will land somewhere between $75-90. Many tech companies' valuations are garbage. Tesla will find its place in automotive industry though still be valued slightly above due to its brand recognition and the tech and solar power element of the company. 


It's just a matter of deciding when to part ways with Elon and not an if. 


This is just my two bananas. 


TL:DR Tesla may go down to $80/share but that's not necessarily something that will affect the company in a negative way. It may be a relief for management instead.","$TSLA's conundrum - Will Elon get fired? A few things first;

# [Stock futures fall slightly as control of Congress is still unclear](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/08/stock-futures-are-little-changed-as-wall-street-awaits-results-of-midterm-elections.html)

*****
> Stock futures were slightly lower — following recent market gains — as results of the midterm elections provided no clear answers about who would control Congress yet.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 123 points, or about 0.4%. S&P 500 futures shed 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.3%.
*****
> Stocks are coming off three-straight days of gains into the election, where Wall Street was expecting Republicans to gain ground and block any future tax and spending plans. The Dow climbed 333 points on Tuesday for its third-straight session of gaining more than 1%.
*****
> But control of Congress was not clear. NBC News was not yet projecting control of the House of Representatives with an NBC estimate suggesting Republicans could win 220 seats, which would be a narrow majority.
*****
> In one of the key races that could determine Senate control, Democrat John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz for the pivotal Senate seat in Pennsylvania, according to an NBC News projection. Oz had the backing of former President Donald Trump, whose endorsed candidates saw spotty levels of success across the country. Critical Senate races in Georgia and Nevada were unresolved.
*****
> “It looks like the strong Republican win that was anticipated yesterday did not happen, and that reduces the chance of the Congress and the Senate extremely lowering spending of the President,” said Bokeh Capital’s Kim Forrest.
*****
> While the election captivated market attention, investors may want to move on now as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to bring down inflation, potentially tipping the economy into recession.
*****
> The political landscape “will fascinate the Washington chattering class, but for the markets, the focus will shift to whether a recession looms, whether the Fed will end its tightening this winter, and whether a truce and negotiations are possible in the Ukraine war,” wrote Greg Valliere, chief U.S. policy strategist at AGF Investments.
*****

# [Stock futures fall slightly as control of Congress is still unclear](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/08/stock-futures-are-little-changed-as-wall-street-awaits-results-of-midterm-elections.html)

*****
> Stock futures were slightly lower — following recent market gains — as results of the midterm elections provided no clear answers about who would control Congress yet.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 123 points, or about 0.4%. S&P 500 futures shed 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.3%.
*****
> Stocks are coming off three-straight days of gains into the election, where Wall Street was expecting Republicans to gain ground and block any future tax and spending plans. The Dow climbed 333 points on Tuesday for its third-straight session of gaining more than 1%.
*****
> But control of Congress was not clear. NBC News was not yet projecting control of the House of Representatives with an NBC estimate suggesting Republicans could win 220 seats, which would be a narrow majority.
*****
> In one of the key races that could determine Senate control, Democrat John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz for the pivotal Senate seat in Pennsylvania, according to an NBC News projection. Oz had the backing of former President Donald Trump, whose endorsed candidates saw spotty levels of success across the country. Critical Senate races in Georgia and Nevada were unresolved.
*****
> “It looks like the strong Republican win that was anticipated yesterday did not happen, and that reduces the chance of the Congress and the Senate extremely lowering spending of the President,” said Bokeh Capital’s Kim Forrest.
*****
> While the election captivated market attention, investors may want to move on now as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to bring down inflation, potentially tipping the economy into recession.
*****
> The political landscape “will fascinate the Washington chattering class, but for the markets, the focus will shift to whether a recession looms, whether the Fed will end its tightening this winter, and whether a truce and negotiations are possible in the Ukraine war,” wrote Greg Valliere, chief U.S. policy strategist at AGF Investments.
*****
> The market’s recent rally occurred at the front end of a strong seasonal period. Historically, stocks tend to rise after midterm elections and the policy clarity it brings, and the final two months of the year are considered a bullish period for investors.
*****
> Shares of Facebook parent Meta Platforms rose 3% premarket after the social media giant announced it will be laying off more than 11,000 workers. Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was too optimistic about growth and now needs to streamline the company.
*****
> One stock that weighed on futures was Disney, which fell more than 8% in early trading after the entertainment giant missed estimates on the top and bottom lines for its fiscal fourth quarter.

* This week’s Watchlist
* This Week’s lotto 10 bagger Play

Ok so let's get this show on the road

We  absolutely crushed it! So missed $TWLO that was a bad play, $TSLA never  ran to $250 but some profit was made there, if you got out early (i  didnt). And $NFLX & $PIN never triggered, so no play.

But earnings plays $CVNA $SQ $ROKU $ETSY $AMD (everyone thought this wouldnt run) $MRNA all were home runs.

Economic  events FOMC meeting went as planned too everyone said 75bps would sell  off, but it ran as expected, then we played the Speech as went along.

Watchlist, $DB, $SPY also played out as expected, so all in all good week!

11:00 AM Michigan Consumer Sentiment

Obviously  all these are important, but the only one we would be interested in  playing would be the CPI day. You can play CPI day 2 ways

**Option 1:**

Wait  for the results, after the initial drop or jump, the day usually  follows the same direction, you dont have to guess, and you would make  the ALOT of $$ by waiting it out and picking direction after that. If  you play same day options, chop might kill your plays anyway. This is  definetly not a bad option, and the drop or spike really does go on for  the rest of the day, if you check the previous reports thats always the  case.

**Option 2:**  
Speculate,  so Analysts' estimates are for a y/y Oct. CPI of 7.9%, and Cleveland  Fed estimates a y/y CPI of 8.1%. Analysts are either being overtly  bullish, or they something we dont. 60% of issues with last CPI were  supply side driven, while 28% was demand driven as per the Moody’s chart  below.

https://preview.redd.it/b8552gn2oiy91.png?width=596&format=png&auto=webp&s=03b676ffdd74a81dae13cd57e5e2fab4719c7c0d

So  the question we ask ourselves is, have any of those come down in the  last month? The war Ukraine is still ongoing, so thats not changing.  COVID impact has a subsided a little so we can expect some but not alot  of improvements there. The housing shortage might even be worse, with  the high interest rates, people may not be able to afford houses even if  sellers decrease prices as they afraid to lock in a high rate (as they  should be)

So that leaves us with  the demand side, which is what the Fed’s have been working on. We can  expect as rates are higher, to see better numbers when it comes things  that are loans depended, so we can see a weakening in Automative  pricing/demand ( A look through FB sales groups and twitter car  ‘’influncers’’ would suggest that this is indeed happening) Same goes  for most consumer durables based on my research through sales groups and  experts. This is to be taken with a grain of salt offcourse as i dont  have access to Big Data like the analysts do, but it does explain why  they might be expecting a big reduction in CPI.

The  Last time we were below 8.1% was Feb 2022, if we go below 8 i expect a  bull run like no other, as its almost a certainty that we dont 75bps  anymore and Fed will definitely soften their approach. Combine that with  mid elections a typically bullish time. And lots of cash on the  sidelines, the run will be glorious if that happens. I will be siding  with the analysts on this one, and taking a small calls position before  market opens $SPX. And will leave plenty of cash in case im wrong, and  it goes the other way around.  
Remember CPI day is one of those days where you can make alot of money without risking too much. So play accordingly.

* Transportation
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 4:05 pm EST
* Estimates: EPS $0.069 & Revenue $1.056B

* Estimates: EPS $0.554 & Revenue $21.3B

* Health Care/Biotechnology
* Estimate Earnings Call Time: 8:00 am EST

# Watchlist

**- $TSLA Long**  
Looks  like the market might be bullish till CPI, $TSLA Held $203.84 Support  as long this line holds, first TP for me will be $216.8 and then $224

**- $AMD Long/Short**  
Has  not been able to break throught the $62.7 level since earnings, pretty  much in a channel now, if it breaks resistance will go long, if it cant  will short till next support at $60

https://preview.redd.it/p0gb25n4oiy91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=d05e6b5ae9e4dfc0b496c9e6fbb5b2a848593300

**- $VIX Long**

Lot  of chatter lately about VIX big spike coming soon, while i personally  dont see it, the trend lines we drew 4 month ago, remain respected so my  play here, is if we break and hold $25.6 resistance ill take calls, if  that fails we are likely going back to retest the trend and likely break  it all the to $22 at which point i would take profits

# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play

Im  not going to add something just to have a play, i couldn’t find  anything, SPX will for sure be 10X play on CPI day, but beyond that i  got nothing this week. But i will 100% find a good for next week.

Alright,  so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going  through the previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we  went wrong.

If you are a non-virgin, you understand that the sole purpose for investing and trading is to generate returns, to increase the NAV of your brokerage account and to push your net worth in the upward direction. Why? Because it feels good to have the monetary freedom to do whatever the fuck you want, because green GAIN porn is better than red loss porn, and because it is better to look at your account balance and smile instead of twitch in misery. You are here to make money. You are not here to “be right,” — you are here to generate returns, and preferably, returns in excess of the market, in so much excess of the SPY that you are catapulted towards massive capital appreciation (meaningful tendies) before age 80.

The challenge obviously is that it’s extremely fucking difficult to extract money from the markets, especially with an appropriate level of risk. Unless you are a boomer investing with a 50 year horizon, the markets are designed to fuck you over. Markets are difficult and good opportunities are scarce, especially in a bear market environment like we’ve seen YTD. But remember Warren Buffet said “be something when others are something”? Yes, and today is your opportunity.

Right now, an asymmetrical risk-reward investment window is present in ASTS, a company called AST SpaceMobile, where (i) the disruptive technology and scalable commercialization plan are set to create immense value in the coming months, years and decades, (ii) the macro environment allows for a chance to get in *early* into a potential “millionaire maker” name like NVDA or TSLA, and (iii) a contrarian and concentrated bet can provide incredible upside with manageable level of risk.

I am going to spare you impatient people who are already desperately looking for a TLDR from the “generational opportunity” technical thesis but instead show you the swing TRADE SETUP in ASTS that in my mind has a chance of printing money in the next few weeks and months. Three factors: (1) three meaningful catalysts in mid November, (2) continued business plan execution updates, (3) forces from market participants, potentially with better macro tailwinds, could make the ASTS stock spike, consolidate and push upward in a staircase pattern to high levels. Read on.

# 2/ The Background and the Backers

Notwithstanding the fact that Cathie Wood is washed up, disruptive technology wins in the long-term. Not Roku or Zoom but TRUE innovation that propels humankind forward. ASTS pushes forward that kind of technology, aiming to become the first comprehensive space-based cellular service provider, bridging the connectivity gap across the globe by providing high speed internet access to billions of unconnected people, and powering billions of others who move in and out of coverage even in developed markets like the US.

ASTS is launching a network of satellites to provide these services to any mobile device on the planet. That is achieved through deploying and operating satellite “cell towers” in orbit that will cover the entire Earth with 4G / 5G / LTE signal. The technology links directly to any unmodified smartphone, and unlike Starlink, doesn’t require any additional hardware. This monumental step forward in global connectivity is done through launching proprietary 168 BlueBird satellites into orbit and beaming signal through ASTS patented technology.

All sounds dreamy but this achievement means little for ASTS stock without a solid plan for commercialization. ASTS monetizes the technology through B2B revenue sharing agreements with existing global MNOs like AT&T or Vodafone, who already back the company and even have repeated investments in ASTS. These profit sharing mechanisms effectively remove any customer acquisition or CRM costs for ASTS, and open the opportunity for fat free cash flow margins (Transhumanica thinks 90%+ EBITDA margins) after the network is operational.

Right now, ASTS is on path for business plan execution with one of the main hurdles, having the first BlueWalker 3 satellite in space, already complete in September. The BlueWalker 3 is now orbiting Earth at 17,000 mph and is ready to start “unfurling” on November 10th with testing shortly thereafter.

# 3/ The Astrology and the Price

As a former SPAC, ASTS first got attention in late 2020 and participated in the high-growth mania of that period, reaching a peak price of over $25 in February 2021. To me, that price action is of little significance as it was fueled by an incredible frenzy in overall markets, which soon deflated and normalized later in the year. The company de-SPACed in April 2021. Since then, ASTS displayed remarkable resilience despite being a high-growth, unprofitable company in a very punishing macro environment, where rising interest rates have caused the valuation DCF discount rates to go up, valuation multiples to go down, acutely hurting stocks that have more expected FCF value in the future.

The market is a mystery and it can price something far from true value for a long time. It’s hard to value ASTS as most cash flow is in the future. To me, if execution is good, I’d just do $5B EBITDA in 2026 and 8x multiple, discounted to today at 20% – we’d see $100+ per share valuation. Of course it’s a bit binary so we have to be aware of the downside risks with execution at zero. Nevertheless the equity research people are bullish including Deutsche Bank, Barclays, BRiley. You can also take a look at numbers at Transhumanica or peruse through spacanpanman’s Twitter with more research and projections summarized neatly.

Deutsche Bank note from August when ASTS spiked on BlueWalker news:

[Deutsche Bank comment](https://preview.redd.it/ntirufb0osx91.png?width=992&format=png&auto=webp&s=2800afe12df4affb7e6f9bd89f88f695ab84b4e5)

Interestingly, from June 1, 2022 to present the daily return correlation between ASTS and SPY/QQQ has been remarkably low at around 0.38, which I view as a good thing. Less dependent on daily volatility BS from indexes.

ASTS has traded in a huge channel from the lows of $5.50 to the highs of $14.00 since March 2021 to present. Previous multi-year stock “winners” they all came out of incredibly long consolidation bases which we observe here.

[ TradingView chart of ASTS, 1W ](https://preview.redd.it/dliwwerfqsx91.png?width=1813&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f0034d94a9bd64156001576681377529e74819c)

ASTS year-to-date performance as of October 26 is around -22.8%, compared to the QQQ -34.3%. For a high growth stock, it shows incredible strength — compare it with names like ARKK that are down -62.0% YTD, big dog ABNB -45.2% and SNOW -53.8%. This relative strength gives an indication that despite being currently unprofitable ASTS is likely going to be a leader going forward. Strong stocks are often future winners.

Pretty much from early July to mid-August the indexes grinded higher with QQQ up around 20% — during that time ASTS consolidated in a narrow range. After a few catalysts and good reports in early August, ASTS jumped from around $6.5 to around $14 in a matter of a few weeks. At $14 supply zone, the price action slowed and got slammed down with the overall market and sellers, pushing it down with more inflation worries and higher interest rates woes.

Now we are back at the “support” or demand area, at so-called lows where risk-to-reward becomes super attractive.

# 4/ The Dangers of a Bearish Trade and Previous Catalysts

The no-brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and do nothing but watch how the overall market punishes those stocks. That was the “easy” trade on a company like ASTS that sellers capitalized on. The downward adjustment of multiples due to higher interest rates pushed DCF valuation models lower and ASTS price has been sinking. Naturally, sellers use the opportunity to profit from a structural decline where not much can be done really, the tide goes down and takes every ship down with it. BUT, this can be dangerous when a company is executing on the business plan and has positive developments.

This year we had 2 catalysts that showed what can happen when ASTS keeps executing on the business plan.

1. On March 9, 2022 the news came out that ASTS partnered with SpaceX to deliver their satellites to space. That proved ASTS is meaningfully moving forward with its objectives, and resulted in a ferocious seller covering rally that day, where just “riding with tide” as a seller backfired massively. ASTS stock almost doubled in a day: from lows of $6.20 to highs of $11.40. Later, macro pressures set in again, pushing ASTS lower and the “easy” bear trade came back in, sinking all high risk assets.
2. On July 28, 2022 yet another positive news momentum came in with BW3 satellite launch, that forced a lot of sellers to get out of the way. The frenzied rally more than doubled the stock price in a few weeks. Price went from $6.20 to $14.20, then received expected push back and yielded with broad market weakness.

After Kerrisdale released their bearish report in mid-September price nose dived and we visited the $6 “support area” and bottom of the channel. Interesting to note that previous 2 times, the stock launched from around $6.20.

I think right now there is little idiosyncratic movement to the stock, mostly macro pushing it lower, but that is about to change. Now is an optimal time to get in because we are the bottom of the channel and 3 massive catalysts are upcoming next week, hopefully aided by the tailwinds from macro (not guaranteed) and pressures from sellers relenting as company executes.

# 5/ The New LONG Trade and Upcoming Catalysts

We have an ER update call on Monday, November 14. The three main events will serve as proof of company execution and are likely to push the price up in the next few weeks.

1. Unfurling of the BW3 satellite is going to happen on November 10. Successful completion is likely to serve as a big catalyst to the stock. Satellite will open up and become operational and ready for testing.

[Furled](https://preview.redd.it/5y3wecosqsx91.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd2ae1d0649d74a9db5fe749c1856a6d70bd0d6e)

[Unfurled](https://preview.redd.it/ew43yfytqsx91.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=916c4d08e26af04ecfd10f47c8a29ee23fe2dce1)

2. Testing of the satellite should happen shortly thereafter and an announcement confirmation of working technology is going to be an even larger event for ASTS. This will be the proof that technology works with MNOs.

3. Other funding or partnership updates, like 5G Fund providing indication of possible financing to ASTS may happen by the end of the year, as well as getting licenses in new jurisdictions (Japan), or more partnerships with MNOs.

[Comments on ASTS eligibility for being financed by FCC's 5G Fund](https://preview.redd.it/g1iknnuvqsx91.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=83b7a48437c40c0dc87d4b6a3f9a2ab964afeb4f)

One of the arguments of sellers is that company will need additional funding before generating meaningful free cash flow. Currently they do have runway to revenue, and that gets even better if the FCC 5G fund awards capital to ASTS or if price stays at $18+ for a month, where warrants become redeemable for $200M of capital. Moreover, there’s other non-dilutive financing options, but regardless I think they’ll be explored in second half of 2023 or later.

&#x200B;

[From spacanpanman](https://preview.redd.it/co5m5bc0rsx91.png?width=1194&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a1991c6fc6b4ae4c8fef5e73a7840c35434eeac)

The reason why I think the moves up on positive news could be violent is because there will be additional buying pressure from bearish traders to get cover their positions in face of good data.

Once ASTS confirms that these events are successful, stock will likely become favored by passive and risk-averse investors, with institutional funds buying in and momentum/breakout traders scaling into positions. I believe we’ll get to $14 area if updates are positive, and a breakout above that is likely to clean the path to $18+ which I think is going to be the turning point for the company, that will set it up for long term success.

[ASTS 1D timeframe, imaginary price action.](https://preview.redd.it/wrcwev02ssx91.png?width=1814&format=png&auto=webp&s=c19d086660cb232eff0c4b823b17f25bc91d5f2d)

Disclaimer, Risks:

Past performance is not indicative of future results. This is not financial advice. There are risks of company failing and stock going to zero.

TLDR:

The no brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and just sit tight. But it is dangerous now, especially on a company like ASTS, which is a powder keg that can explode on successful business developments that are to be announced on November 10 and shortly after. Three upcoming catalysts are likely to serve as a repeat of price action in March and August. Although price is artificially suppressed by the macro environment, once that pressure subsides, the stock will stay high and keep pushing forward as company executes.

Positions: 8,000 shares at $6.27

That proved ASTS is meaningfully moving forward with its objectives, and resulted in a ferocious seller covering rally that day, where just “riding with tide” as a seller backfired massively. ASTS stock almost doubled in a day: from lows of $6.20 to highs of $11.40. Later, macro pressures set in again, pushing ASTS lower and the “easy” bear trade came back in, sinking all high risk assets.
2. On July 28, 2022 yet another positive news momentum came in with BW3 satellite launch, that forced a lot of sellers to get out of the way. The frenzied rally more than doubled the stock price in a few weeks. Price went from $6.20 to $14.20, then received expected push back and yielded with broad market weakness.

After Kerrisdale released their bearish report in mid-September price nose dived and we visited the $6 “support area” and bottom of the channel. Interesting to note that previous 2 times, the stock launched from around $6.20.

I think right now there is little idiosyncratic movement to the stock, mostly macro pushing it lower, but that is about to change. Now is an optimal time to get in because we are the bottom of the channel and 3 massive catalysts are upcoming next week, hopefully aided by the tailwinds from macro (not guaranteed) and pressures from sellers relenting as company executes.

# 5/ The New LONG Trade and Upcoming Catalysts

We have an ER update call on Monday, November 14. The three main events will serve as proof of company execution and are likely to push the price up in the next few weeks.

1. Unfurling of the BW3 satellite is going to happen on November 10. Successful completion is likely to serve as a big catalyst to the stock. Satellite will open up and become operational and ready for testing.

[Furled](https://preview.redd.it/5y3wecosqsx91.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd2ae1d0649d74a9db5fe749c1856a6d70bd0d6e)

[Unfurled](https://preview.redd.it/ew43yfytqsx91.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=916c4d08e26af04ecfd10f47c8a29ee23fe2dce1)

2. Testing of the satellite should happen shortly thereafter and an announcement confirmation of working technology is going to be an even larger event for ASTS. This will be the proof that technology works with MNOs.

3. Other funding or partnership updates, like 5G Fund providing indication of possible financing to ASTS may happen by the end of the year, as well as getting licenses in new jurisdictions (Japan), or more partnerships with MNOs.

[Comments on ASTS eligibility for being financed by FCC's 5G Fund](https://preview.redd.it/g1iknnuvqsx91.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=83b7a48437c40c0dc87d4b6a3f9a2ab964afeb4f)

One of the arguments of sellers is that company will need additional funding before generating meaningful free cash flow. Currently they do have runway to revenue, and that gets even better if the FCC 5G fund awards capital to ASTS or if price stays at $18+ for a month, where warrants become redeemable for $200M of capital. Moreover, there’s other non-dilutive financing options, but regardless I think they’ll be explored in second half of 2023 or later.

&#x200B;

[From spacanpanman](https://preview.redd.it/co5m5bc0rsx91.png?width=1194&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a1991c6fc6b4ae4c8fef5e73a7840c35434eeac)

The reason why I think the moves up on positive news could be violent is because there will be additional buying pressure from bearish traders to get cover their positions in face of good data.

Once ASTS confirms that these events are successful, stock will likely become favored by passive and risk-averse investors, with institutional funds buying in and momentum/breakout traders scaling into positions. I believe we’ll get to $14 area if updates are positive, and a breakout above that is likely to clean the path to $18+ which I think is going to be the turning point for the company, that will set it up for long term success.

Disclaimer, Risks:

Past performance is not indicative of future results. This is not financial advice. There are risks of company failing and stock going to zero.

TLDR:

The no brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and just sit tight. But it is dangerous now, especially on a company like ASTS, which is a powder keg that can explode on successful business developments that are to be announced on November 10 and shortly after. Three upcoming catalysts are likely to serve as a repeat of price action in March and August. Although price is artificially suppressed by the macro environment, once that pressure subsides, the stock will stay high and keep pushing forward as company executes.

Positions: 8,000 shares at $6.27

In the U.S. alone, the shortfall stands at five million vehicles, Glass, managing director and analyst at Pella Funds Management, told CNBC’s Street Signs Asia on Monday. “That’s pent-up demand for new vehicles in the U.S. alone, which we think we are going to start seeing next year as supply chains open up.”

Meanwhile, China is also starting to see growth in the autos market once more, after years of decline, according to Glass.

“China has just started to experience growth in its autos market. That market was in decline between 2018 and 2021, but now we have started seeing some growth again,” he added.

## How to play it

His top pick to play the sector is German automaker [BMW](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BMW-DE/).

Glass believes the company is likely to experience cyclical growth next year. It also has a “very well-managed” balance sheet and is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 5.5 — a 20-year low. 

Taken together, this makes the stock look “very, very attractive,” he said

BMW has long made clear its intention to challenge [Tesla’s](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) leadership in electric vehicles. The Bavarian automaker aims to have two million EVs on the roads by 2025 and estimates half of its car sales to comprise EVs by 2030.

Earlier this month, the company [announced plans to invest $1.7 billion](https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0404837EN/bmw-group-announces-1-7-billion-usd-investment-to-build-electric-vehicles-in-the-u-s-and-signs-agreement-with-envision-aesc-for-the-supply-of-battery-cells-to-plant-spartanburg?language=en) in its U.S. operations to build EVs and batteries.

Of this investment, $1 billion has been earmarked to prepare BMW’s existing U.S. manufacturing facility in South Carolina to produce EVs.

The German automaker expects to produce at least six [fully electric models](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/26/bmw-to-build-new-vehicle-at-south-carolina-plant.html) in the U.S. by 2030. 

**″**Going forward, \[the facility\] will also be a major driver for our electrification strategy, and we will produce at least six fully electric BMW X models here by 2030,” BMW Chairman Oliver Zipse said last month.

The remaining $700 million will be used for the construction of a new high-voltage battery assembly center. The company has already announced four additional battery cell factories that will be built in Europe and China to meet its demand for next-generation battery cells.

Shares in BMW are down 12.9% this year, outperforming Tesla, which has lost more than 40% of its market capitalization so far this year.

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&format=png&auto=webp&s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is > 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November.

Firstly lets get something straight. Tesla is not ""the *next* Apple/Amazon/Netflix""... Tesla is the **first** Skynet.

Secondly, Institutions **know** Tesla's value now. My last post made it clear to me that retail (you guys) has clearly bought into the Institutional FUD media-machine. Even Tesla bulls were buying puts. Wow. So what happens when Elon tweets this evening that he's not selling any more (plsss do it tonight elon)? institutions already collected on all your sales at the bottom as well as Elon's liquidity yesterday at rock bottom prices, leaving on the sidelines this huge *emotional-retail buying vaccum of sheer unadulterated FOMO-ready* for their beloved TSLA stock. I reckon you guys might actually blow this thing sky high this week. Thats why I just added to my existing 3x leveraged position with some extra OTM calls expiring this friday. Fuck it.

# $2k to $100k Challenge Update

For those of you who dont know, im 17 trading days in challenge where i trade live everyday, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone everyday.

**Options Starting Amount:** $1000

**Day 17 Closing Amount:** $5038

**Port % Change:** 400%  
**Proof:**

https://preview.redd.it/m7dh205b10x91.jpg?width=1633&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5ecf4dece8117c832473836daf9665ea89ced868

**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800

**Day 17 Closing Amount:** $1500

**Port % Change**: %87.5

I found that people for the most are not really interested in Global/Futures plays, but if you guys want i can definitely add that to the watchlist next week. Let me know in the comments.

This week we gained big by predicting 2 main moves, the drop on the GDP release, we ran on very bad news for Feds, the drop was inevitable. And another big gainer was PCE release, got in PM into SPX calls when i saw Bullish divergence between price action and RSI and added size after PCE meet expectation as it was good news for the Feds and PCE is one of powells favorite metrics to look at for rate hikes.

The following is basically my plan for next week.

# Major Economic Events

**Monday 10/31**

9:45 AM Chicago PMI

10:00 AM Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index Oct

**Tuesday 11/01**

9:45 AM S&P Global PMI Final Oct

10:00 AM ISM Manufacturing PMI Oct

10:00 AM Jolts Job Openings Sep

**Wednesday 11/02**

8:15 AM ADP Employment Change Oct

2:00 PM Fed Interest Rate Decision

2:30 PM Fed Press Conference

**Thursday 11/03**

8:30 AM Balance of Trade Sep

10:00 AM ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI Oct

**Friday 11/04**

8:30 AM Non Farm Payroll Oct

8:30 AM Unemployment Rate Oct

So all these are very important events that will move the market, but the offcourse the important event is the Fed Conference on wednesday which is the only event ill playing.

So my play here is in 2 parts.

Part 1 - The Rate Hike

Believe it or not the rate hike is not that important and is unlikely to affect the market that much, let me explain.

https://preview.redd.it/owgfdped10x91.png?width=1262&format=png&auto=webp&s=a466d5bcb721e09c65cc449128a726a17b262b77

As of Friday 28Oct the market is pricing

0% chance of 100Bps

81.3% chance of 75Bps

18.7% chance of 50Bps

Now in my previous watchlist we have been predicting the rate hikes right every single time by just following the highest odds, the Fed doesnt like to freak the market. They also dont want the market to rally too much so its also unlikely that we get 50Bps, in addition to that why do 50Bps when they can get away with 75Bps without freaking out the market.

In all cases, they definitely not doing 100bps, if they do 75bps as expected we run a little (ill tell why a little later on) if they 50Bps we run alot. It seems to me for the first part the very obvious play here is calls before the rate hike, and sell on the spike for that delicious IV spiked premium.

Part 2 - The Meeting

Well this is where it gets very tricky, so as you may know that market has been rallying lately and thats because alot of people are expecting the Fed to pivot, or at least start talking about pivoting this time.

If they say we are pivoting the run continues at least till we hit the 200MA on the SPX 1D chart, if they we cant do that yet, we are getting new 52 week lows.

This part is easy to figure the part is figuring out whether they will pivot or not, for funsies ill give you my expectations, but honeslty im going to play it by ear. Im 50/50 on what they plan to do, and the move will be so big you can get in at time and still make $$, you can also do a straddle.

Anyway Looking at the PCE report inflation is not so bad, thats why ran hard after the report was out, its not the best report in the world, but its an improvement for sure, add to that the St. Louis Fed came out with report stating the Fed is wrong to look only at CPI as it is lagging data heavily weight down with rent prices going up and that if we remove rent, inflation has actually cooled off and we are actually deflating now.

The fed doesnt want to risk deflation by forcing a recession when we dont really need to. (This is a much worse scenario than inflation, thats why the Fed is being careful)

On the other hand, GDP came out pretty damn positive, the so called earnings recession and end of the world stock market destruction is nowhere to be seen. While some growth tech companies ‘’missed’’ (most of them just lowered guidance, they didnt actually miss) most of the not so sexy companies beat. This is good for the stock market, VERY bad for the feds, this means that demand is not getting crushed, and if demand is high, prices will likely remain elevated. So all this might signal to the Fed that job not done yet, we need more pain.

As you can see there are very good reasons for the Fed to go either way, i think we get a pivot for an important reason no one is really talking about. The US treasuries the most liquid market in the world, is losing its liquidity. With UK and Japan selling US Treasures to prop up their currienses and markets and the Fed tightening and no longer buying assets this is starting to affect the treasuries market.

Guys if treasure market goes no bid or crashes, 2008 + 2001 + Great depression will NOT even come close to the global collapse that we might experience. Central Banks Chairs around the world have been pestering Powell about that recently. I think they will do anything to make sure that doesnt happen.

But like i said we shall see.

# Watchlist

**- $TSLA Long**

https://preview.redd.it/xf5d6mcf10x91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0ee3eae96a82cee42fcf3f93488dfd70d3e66a5

If TSLA continues its run, and finally break the 230 resistance, we can easily see a run to $250 level, will take calls on Monday

**- $SPY Short**

https://preview.redd.it/q96wt5pg10x91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=278dc0bbd5025aca467cb822a03603f7ecd7a914

Whether we run or not after FOMC the 1Hr is VERY over extended, and we are due a pullback, its not going to be a sharp one likely but still could make for a nice trade.

**- $PIN Long**

https://preview.redd.it/em2jx6hh10x91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=754fa108ef21a21dc4a22bb0b10c6c4d855fd71c

Strong beat by PINS still has room for more if it breaks the $25.9 resistance we can get $27.95, quickly, taking some call here for a possible run

**- $DB Short**

https://preview.redd.it/bt550y5i10x91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=20ba5802ea52e0d4b92c01b6f45dd1e765f2b507

Ran so much on that earnings beat, creating a short gap fill to $9.5. Its also very Overbought on the Daily chart making a nice %3 move down at least, picking up some puts as long as it doesnt move down before the open

# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play

Alright boys and girls so played this one before as 10 bagger and we got our 10 bag (and then some) But this one has more left in the tank for another run.

Its NFLX baby.

So we ran hard before and on earnings securing our 10 bag ( This was my firs 10bag call on my first watchlist, check my profile for proof).

Now it crossed the 200MA on the daily chart after filling half the gap so take a little rest. What we are looking for here is for NFLX to reclaims 50 and 21MA  on the 1hr time frame. Once we get we reclaim that we will continue to fill the remainder of the gap fill all the way to $330

Alright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week’s play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.

What I have learned the last two weeks doing options on stocks that have earnings coming out. So last week I was up 4k on TSLA calls right before earnings held into after hours and lost a total of 18k. Had I sold before market closed I would have been up 4k. Then again this week had Intel puts for 24 and was up 3k going into earnings. Tomorrow I’ll lose majority of it unless something happens but my advice to anyone new playing options on earnings is to sell before market closes if the earnings report is after hours. You’ll make money regardless provided you bought a couple days before the earnings call leading up to the day before earnings. I made most of my losses on TSLA back from meta puts and yea I’ll lose my initial 1k in puts on Intel but will makeup for it on my other plays in GILD, Xom, and spy. Just wanted to share what I’ve learned to help others make better decisions on plays.","Best advice I can give on options going into earnings So usually I’m a 🌈 🐻 on put options for spy.

Compare that to the USA with 2.1% lithium and 15% rare earths.

China has 30x the lithium capacity of the United States. Is China gonna keep selling lithium and rare earths to an American company, or will they try to cripple the US economy and keep everything domestic in response?

China has lax environmental regulations which is why their mining industry is so big. For example a Canadian lithium mine went bankrupt after the Canadian government spent half a billion dollars, hurdle after bureaucratic hurdle, environmental, indigenous, etc. etc.

Lets say theoretically everyone on the planet wanted to buy a Tesla.. Regardless of that demand, Tesla's limiting factor is currently the supply side, and can only get worse. I haven't even mentioned the competition from other automakers now in the EV space, imagine all the big automakers scrambling more than they are now for lithium.

Good Luck to everyone, and may your spirits stay high in these crazy times.","Why I think $TSLA is absolutely fucked Now with this semiconductor sanctioning news, the only thing China has left in their back pocket is their lithium and rare earths.

**Character**: With all that being said, he is kind of an annoying human. If he wasn't rich, wasn't good at engineering, wasn't changing the world, no one would like him personally. Mother of his children and x wife is all the character reference you need. 

**Interest Rates:** With the interest rate environment drastically different, and the TSLA bros starting to get underwater, his magic touch is wearing off. Just look at the TSLA chart YTD and try to feel positive about that. You can't. 

**Comps**: Kanye was the greatest rapper of all time. Trump was the greatest president of all time (not saying I agree, but some do). Elon is the greatest engineer of all time. No one really cares about their accomplishments if they don't comply with the social fabric of the new woke left America. It really doesn't matter about facts, only about feels. Not sure Elon gives people the good vibes he used to. Trump, Kanye, Elon are the three free speech musketeers - two out of these three are officially cancelled already. 

**Annoying**: Sink into twitter is a bitch move. It mocks the establishment, mocks the left. He threatens to fire 75% of the staff - even if they deserve it, this is a very ""non left"" thing to do. 

**Women**: He keeps impregnating women and then leaving them. Lefties don't like that. He impregnates his employees as well. I am sure there are some settlements out there he has made, or an abortion he paid for, just a matter of time until someone attacks him. 

**Anti-Vax Narative:** He is anti vax in some regard. He believes in science for sure, but isn't afraid to criticize WHO, Fauci, Biden, The Government, Big Pharma or other players on the left. 

**Capitalism is Bad Now:** He is anti worker, pro capitalist. Expects people to sleep in the factory, return to work, do his bidding or be unemployed. 

**Big Tech is Bad Now:** Both left and right hate “big tech” - this is one of the only things that politicians agree on. Social media is bad, consumer privacy should be protected, tech companies shouldn't have more power than politicians. 

**Disrespects the Government:** He smokes weed on Joe Rohan with privileged defense contracts. This is just another disrespectful move to bite the hand that feeds him. He shits on Biden, Biden shits on him. Elon drops memes like he is 14 years old mocking the establishment, and he has a very large following - that makes him a target. 

**Indian Giver:** He demands the Gov pay for his starlink service for ukraine when the gov, nor ukraine, never asked him to save the day like that. You don't invite your friend to dinner, then complain and ask them to pay for it after the fact. Indian giving is a bitch move. 

**Conspiracy Theorist:** He promotes Russel Brands youtube channel. Sure MSM is total bullshit, but that doesn't make RB a source of truth. If you promote stuff like that, you are playing for the wrong team. The team that gets cancelled.  

**\[Redacted\]:** His is king of ""that which can't be named here"" the bros are and their coins are not doing so hot right now. Powell actively wants them gone. The social media influencers who promoted these pump and dump coins are facing their time in court, Elon is the main dude pumping.

**Not Green Enough:** The ""green"" left is starting to be alienated by Elon specifically. He is too rich, too successful, to capitalist. Lets not forget the cars themselves are not exactly ""green"" to produce and the whole idea of EVs being ""more green"" than ICE cars is a u argument that doesn't stand up to scrutiny. 

**Lack of Immunity:** He doesn't have ""founder control"" of TSLA. He actually can be removed, not saying he will or that he should, just stating it is possible. 

**False Promises:** He has a pending FSD lawsuit because - well, FSD is a complete lie. Its not even close and yet it is marketed AND SOLD as available. Many hundreds of thousands of people paid 10k for FSD, and it simply doesn't exist.  Where is the cyber truck? What is the deal with a robot 10 years behind Boston Dynamics and Honda? Bullet proof glass? Semi truck deliveries? Bigger than Apple and Aramco? 

**Free Speech:** The Twitter purchase removes the ""town square"" from the free speech arena. It is now private speech, controlled by one individual. It's also a huge distraction to his more meaningful missions at SpaceX, Tesla, Starlink, Boring Co etc - this alienates his investors and bankers across the ""real"" companies as he spends his time fixing the dumpster fires at a shit company.  

I had another post on [TSLA as a stock losing its growth trajectory](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y1dtf7/tsla_is_dying/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and I recommended [everyone sell calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y8ehch/tesla_just_ended_the_rally/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) which everyone criticized but turned into gains for me. 

I have a Tesla, its a great car. I have starlink. I want people to go to Mars. Personally, I fully support Elon and couldn't care less what type of ""person"" he is - but that is not the climate we are in today. 

What do you guys think the chances are of Elon being socially ""cancelled"" - or there at least being an attempt - in the next 12 months?

93,TSLA,1666801602.0,Mobileye IPO already up over 30% today. INTC is permanently keeping 400m shares basically assigning .1 MBLY share to every INTC share.,"Because INTC is keeping 50% of all Mobileye shares long term, that means they will keep 400 million shares  for their shareholders (~800m total shares, although for now they still own 95% - they may eventually offload the 45% if the value and demand is there).

 there are 4 billion INTC shares, so **each share is basically assigned 0.1 mobileye share, or every 10 intel shares includes 1 full mobileye share.**

So INTC share price is really discounted by 10% of a mobileye share. eg Mobileye at $28 means that an INTC share is worth $2.8 of mobileye value, so at the current price of $27.5, the MBLY part is $2.8 and the INTC part is $24.7 (MBLY at current cheap prices is worth 11.33% of an INTC share price).

Once you factor in  the dividend for the INTC part only because MBLY doesnt pay a dividend, it gets even better. Its great the market can now assign some value to INTC assets instead of ignoring them, or guessing random amounts. If MBLY increases it might reach over 25% of each INTC share dollar weighting at some point.

Lastly a large increase in MBLY will bring in lots of capital to INTC when they sell another 45% of the company, which they will only do if the price shoots up and has large demand. 

Maybe even Elon will secretly buy some as TSLA self driving is more like human driving with some aids and hes slowed down on making false promises to his shareholders about it recently.","Mobileye IPO already up over 30% today.
