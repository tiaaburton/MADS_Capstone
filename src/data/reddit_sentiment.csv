 I obviously got very lucky that TSLA severely underperformed today and happened to hit my target.

If you are a non-virgin, you understand that the sole purpose for investing and trading is to generate returns, to increase the NAV of your brokerage account and to push your net worth in the upward direction. Why? Because it feels good to have the monetary freedom to do whatever the fuck you want, because green GAIN porn is better than red loss porn, and because it is better to look at your account balance and smile instead of twitch in misery. You are here to make money. You are not here to ‚Äúbe right,‚Äù ‚Äî you are here to generate returns, and preferably, returns in excess of the market, in so much excess of the SPY that you are catapulted towards massive capital appreciation (meaningful tendies) before age 80.

The challenge obviously is that it‚Äôs extremely fucking difficult to extract money from the markets, especially with an appropriate level of risk. Unless you are a boomer investing with a 50 year horizon, the markets are designed to fuck you over. Markets are difficult and good opportunities are scarce, especially in a bear market environment like we‚Äôve seen YTD. But remember Warren Buffet said ‚Äúbe something when others are something‚Äù? Yes, and today is your opportunity.

Right now, an asymmetrical risk-reward investment window is present in ASTS, a company called AST SpaceMobile, where (i) the disruptive technology and scalable commercialization plan are set to create immense value in the coming months, years and decades, (ii) the macro environment allows for a chance to get in *early* into a potential ‚Äúmillionaire maker‚Äù name like NVDA or TSLA, and (iii) a contrarian and concentrated bet can provide incredible upside with manageable level of risk.

Three factors: (1) three meaningful catalysts in mid November, (2) continued business plan execution updates, (3) forces from market participants, potentially with better macro tailwinds, could make the ASTS stock spike, consolidate and push upward in a staircase pattern to high levels. Read on.

# 2/ The Background and the Backers

Notwithstanding the fact that Cathie Wood is washed up, disruptive technology wins in the long-term. Not Roku or Zoom but TRUE innovation that propels humankind forward. ASTS pushes forward that kind of technology, aiming to become the first comprehensive space-based cellular service provider, bridging the connectivity gap across the globe by providing high speed internet access to billions of unconnected people, and powering billions of others who move in and out of coverage even in developed markets like the US.

ASTS is launching a network of satellites to provide these services to any mobile device on the planet. That is achieved through deploying and operating satellite ‚Äúcell towers‚Äù in orbit that will cover the entire Earth with 4G / 5G / LTE signal. The technology links directly to any unmodified smartphone, and unlike Starlink, doesn‚Äôt require any additional hardware. This monumental step forward in global connectivity is done through launching proprietary 168 BlueBird satellites into orbit and beaming signal through ASTS patented technology.

All sounds dreamy but this achievement means little for ASTS stock without a solid plan for commercialization. ASTS monetizes the technology through B2B revenue sharing agreements with existing global MNOs like AT&T or Vodafone, who already back the company and even have repeated investments in ASTS. These profit sharing mechanisms effectively remove any customer acquisition or CRM costs for ASTS, and open the opportunity for fat free cash flow margins (Transhumanica thinks 90%+ EBITDA margins) after the network is operational.

Right now, ASTS is on path for business plan execution with one of the main hurdles, having the first BlueWalker 3 satellite in space, already complete in September. The BlueWalker 3 is now orbiting Earth at 17,000 mph and is ready to start ‚Äúunfurling‚Äù on November 10th with testing shortly thereafter.

The TEAM: Abel Avellan, Rakuten, Invesat, Vodafone, AMERICAN TOWER corporation.

The guy in charge, the CEO is Abel Avellan. A chad who was founder of another satellite-based communications company EMC that he sold for $550M in July 2016, using proceeds for initial funding of ASTS. He is executing on the business plan with skin in the game with 78M shares (\~$500M currently) and majority of his networth tied in ASTS shares.

Other direct backers that have stakes include **Rakuten, Invesat, Vodafone and American Tower Corporation**. On top of that ASTS has partnerships and conversations with multiple MNOs in different jurisdictions to provide their service through the B2B revenue sharing model once satellites are operational. Quick cap table. Total shares outstanding 183.0M from 10Q as of August 5, 2022.

* BRiley equity research has outstanding $15 PT.
* DB equity research has outstanding $30 PT.
* Barclays equity research has outstanding $15 PT.
* Also people on the ASTS subreddit have provided incredibly detailed research on the technology and the company.

The NON-BELIEVERS:

* Kerrisdale Capital released some bearish seller research if you‚Äôre interested in reading a negative scenario case.

# 3/ The Astrology and the Price

As a former SPAC, ASTS first got attention in late 2020 and participated in the high-growth mania of that period, reaching a peak price of over $25 in February 2021. To me, that price action is of little significance as it was fueled by an incredible frenzy in overall markets, which soon deflated and normalized later in the year. The company de-SPACed in April 2021. Since then, ASTS displayed remarkable resilience despite being a high-growth, unprofitable company in a very punishing macro environment, where rising interest rates have caused the valuation DCF discount rates to go up, valuation multiples to go down, acutely hurting stocks that have more expected FCF value in the future.

The market is a mystery and it can price something far from true value for a long time. It‚Äôs hard to value ASTS as most cash flow is in the future. To me, if execution is good, I‚Äôd just do $5B EBITDA in 2026 and 8x multiple, discounted to today at 20% ‚Äì we‚Äôd see $100+ per share valuation. Of course it‚Äôs a bit binary so we have to be aware of the downside risks with execution at zero. Nevertheless the equity research people are bullish including Deutsche Bank, Barclays, BRiley. You can also take a look at numbers at Transhumanica or peruse through spacanpanman‚Äôs Twitter with more research and projections summarized neatly.

Deutsche Bank note from August when ASTS spiked on BlueWalker news:

[Deutsche Bank comment](https://preview.redd.it/ntirufb0osx91.png?width=992&format=png&auto=webp&s=2800afe12df4affb7e6f9bd89f88f695ab84b4e5)

Interestingly, from June 1, 2022 to present the daily return correlation between ASTS and SPY/QQQ has been remarkably low at around 0.38, which I view as a good thing. Less dependent on daily volatility BS from indexes.

ASTS has traded in a huge channel from the lows of $5.50 to the highs of $14.00 since March 2021 to present. Previous multi-year stock ‚Äúwinners‚Äù they all came out of incredibly long consolidation bases which we observe here.

[ TradingView chart of ASTS, 1W ](https://preview.redd.it/dliwwerfqsx91.png?width=1813&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f0034d94a9bd64156001576681377529e74819c)

ASTS year-to-date performance as of October 26 is around -22.8%, compared to the QQQ -34.3%. For a high growth stock, it shows incredible strength ‚Äî compare it with names like ARKK that are down -62.0% YTD, big dog ABNB -45.2% and SNOW -53.8%. This relative strength gives an indication that despite being currently unprofitable ASTS is likely going to be a leader going forward. Strong stocks are often future winners.

Pretty much from early July to mid-August the indexes grinded higher with QQQ up around 20% ‚Äî during that time ASTS consolidated in a narrow range. After a few catalysts and good reports in early August, ASTS jumped from around $6.5 to around $14 in a matter of a few weeks. At $14 supply zone, the price action slowed and got slammed down with the overall market and sellers, pushing it down with more inflation worries and higher interest rates woes.

Now we are back at the ‚Äúsupport‚Äù or demand area, at so-called lows where risk-to-reward becomes super attractive.

# 4/ The Dangers of a Bearish Trade and Previous Catalysts

The no-brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and do nothing but watch how the overall market punishes those stocks. That was the ‚Äúeasy‚Äù trade on a company like ASTS that sellers capitalized on. The downward adjustment of multiples due to higher interest rates pushed DCF valuation models lower and ASTS price has been sinking. Naturally, sellers use the opportunity to profit from a structural decline where not much can be done really, the tide goes down and takes every ship down with it. BUT, this can be dangerous when a company is executing on the business plan and has positive developments.

This year we had 2 catalysts that showed what can happen when ASTS keeps executing on the business plan.

1. On March 9, 2022 the news came out that ASTS partnered with SpaceX to deliver their satellites to space. That proved ASTS is meaningfully moving forward with its objectives, and resulted in a ferocious seller covering rally that day, where just ‚Äúriding with tide‚Äù as a seller backfired massively. ASTS stock almost doubled in a day: from lows of $6.20 to highs of $11.40. Later, macro pressures set in again, pushing ASTS lower and the ‚Äúeasy‚Äù bear trade came back in, sinking all high risk assets.
2. On July 28, 2022 yet another positive news momentum came in with BW3 satellite launch, that forced a lot of sellers to get out of the way. The frenzied rally more than doubled the stock price in a few weeks. Price went from $6.20 to $14.20, then received expected push back and yielded with broad market weakness.

After Kerrisdale released their bearish report in mid-September price nose dived and we visited the $6 ‚Äúsupport area‚Äù and bottom of the channel. Interesting to note that previous 2 times, the stock launched from around $6.20.

I think right now there is little idiosyncratic movement to the stock, mostly macro pushing it lower, but that is about to change. Now is an optimal time to get in because we are the bottom of the channel and 3 massive catalysts are upcoming next week, hopefully aided by the tailwinds from macro (not guaranteed) and pressures from sellers relenting as company executes.

# 5/ The New LONG Trade and Upcoming Catalysts

We have an ER update call on Monday, November 14. The three main events will serve as proof of company execution and are likely to push the price up in the next few weeks.

1. Unfurling of the BW3 satellite is going to happen on November 10. Successful completion is likely to serve as a big catalyst to the stock. Satellite will open up and become operational and ready for testing.

[Furled](https://preview.redd.it/5y3wecosqsx91.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd2ae1d0649d74a9db5fe749c1856a6d70bd0d6e)

[Unfurled](https://preview.redd.it/ew43yfytqsx91.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=916c4d08e26af04ecfd10f47c8a29ee23fe2dce1)

2. Testing of the satellite should happen shortly thereafter and an announcement confirmation of working technology is going to be an even larger event for ASTS. This will be the proof that technology works with MNOs.

3. Other funding or partnership updates, like 5G Fund providing indication of possible financing to ASTS may happen by the end of the year, as well as getting licenses in new jurisdictions (Japan), or more partnerships with MNOs.

[Comments on ASTS eligibility for being financed by FCC's 5G Fund](https://preview.redd.it/g1iknnuvqsx91.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=83b7a48437c40c0dc87d4b6a3f9a2ab964afeb4f)

One of the arguments of sellers is that company will need additional funding before generating meaningful free cash flow. Currently they do have runway to revenue, and that gets even better if the FCC 5G fund awards capital to ASTS or if price stays at $18+ for a month, where warrants become redeemable for $200M of capital. Moreover, there‚Äôs other non-dilutive financing options, but regardless I think they‚Äôll be explored in second half of 2023 or later.

&#x200B;

[From spacanpanman](https://preview.redd.it/co5m5bc0rsx91.png?width=1194&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a1991c6fc6b4ae4c8fef5e73a7840c35434eeac)

The reason why I think the moves up on positive news could be violent is because there will be additional buying pressure from bearish traders to get cover their positions in face of good data.

Once ASTS confirms that these events are successful, stock will likely become favored by passive and risk-averse investors, with institutional funds buying in and momentum/breakout traders scaling into positions. I believe we‚Äôll get to $14 area if updates are positive, and a breakout above that is likely to clean the path to $18+ which I think is going to be the turning point for the company, that will set it up for long term success.

[ASTS 1D timeframe, imaginary price action.](https://preview.redd.it/wrcwev02ssx91.png?width=1814&format=png&auto=webp&s=c19d086660cb232eff0c4b823b17f25bc91d5f2d)

Disclaimer, Risks:

Past performance is not indicative of future results. This is not financial advice. There are risks of company failing and stock going to zero.

TLDR:

The no brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and just sit tight. But it is dangerous now, especially on a company like ASTS, which is a powder keg that can explode on successful business developments that are to be announced on November 10 and shortly after. Three upcoming catalysts are likely to serve as a repeat of price action in March and August. Although price is artificially suppressed by the macro environment, once that pressure subsides, the stock will stay high and keep pushing forward as company executes.

The guy in charge, the CEO is Abel Avellan. A chad who was founder of another satellite-based communications company EMC that he sold for $550M in July 2016, using proceeds for initial funding of ASTS. He is executing on the business plan with skin in the game with 78M shares (\~$500M currently) and majority of his networth tied in ASTS shares.

Other direct backers that have stakes include **Rakuten, Invesat, Vodafone and American Tower Corporation**. On top of that ASTS has partnerships and conversations with multiple MNOs in different jurisdictions to provide their service through the B2B revenue sharing model once satellites are operational. Quick cap table. Total shares outstanding 183.0M from 10Q as of August 5, 2022.

# 3/ The Astrology and the Price

As a former SPAC, ASTS first got attention in late 2020 and participated in the high-growth mania of that period, reaching a peak price of over $25 in February 2021. To me, that price action is of little significance as it was fueled by an incredible frenzy in overall markets, which soon deflated and normalized later in the year. The company de-SPACed in April 2021. Since then, ASTS displayed remarkable resilience despite being a high-growth, unprofitable company in a very punishing macro environment, where rising interest rates have caused the valuation DCF discount rates to go up, valuation multiples to go down, acutely hurting stocks that have more expected FCF value in the future.

The market is a mystery and it can price something far from true value for a long time. It‚Äôs hard to value ASTS as most cash flow is in the future. To me, if execution is good, I‚Äôd just do $5B EBITDA in 2026 and 8x multiple, discounted to today at 20% ‚Äì we‚Äôd see $100+ per share valuation. Of course it‚Äôs a bit binary so we have to be aware of the downside risks with execution at zero. Nevertheless the equity research people are bullish including Deutsche Bank, Barclays, BRiley. You can also take a look at numbers at Transhumanica or peruse through spacanpanman‚Äôs Twitter with more research and projections summarized neatly.

Deutsche Bank note from August when ASTS spiked on BlueWalker news:

[Deutsche Bank comment](https://preview.redd.it/ntirufb0osx91.png?width=992&format=png&auto=webp&s=2800afe12df4affb7e6f9bd89f88f695ab84b4e5)

Interestingly, from June 1, 2022 to present the daily return correlation between ASTS and SPY/QQQ has been remarkably low at around 0.38, which I view as a good thing. Less dependent on daily volatility BS from indexes.

ASTS has traded in a huge channel from the lows of $5.50 to the highs of $14.00 since March 2021 to present. Previous multi-year stock ‚Äúwinners‚Äù they all came out of incredibly long consolidation bases which we observe here.

[ TradingView chart of ASTS, 1W ](https://preview.redd.it/dliwwerfqsx91.png?width=1813&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f0034d94a9bd64156001576681377529e74819c)

ASTS year-to-date performance as of October 26 is around -22.8%, compared to the QQQ -34.3%. For a high growth stock, it shows incredible strength ‚Äî compare it with names like ARKK that are down -62.0% YTD, big dog ABNB -45.2% and SNOW -53.8%. This relative strength gives an indication that despite being currently unprofitable ASTS is likely going to be a leader going forward. Strong stocks are often future winners.

Pretty much from early July to mid-August the indexes grinded higher with QQQ up around 20% ‚Äî during that time ASTS consolidated in a narrow range. After a few catalysts and good reports in early August, ASTS jumped from around $6.5 to around $14 in a matter of a few weeks. At $14 supply zone, the price action slowed and got slammed down with the overall market and sellers, pushing it down with more inflation worries and higher interest rates woes.

Now we are back at the ‚Äúsupport‚Äù or demand area, at so-called lows where risk-to-reward becomes super attractive.

# 4/ The Dangers of a Bearish Trade and Previous Catalysts

The no-brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and do nothing but watch how the overall market punishes those stocks. That was the ‚Äúeasy‚Äù trade on a company like ASTS that sellers capitalized on. The downward adjustment of multiples due to higher interest rates pushed DCF valuation models lower and ASTS price has been sinking. Naturally, sellers use the opportunity to profit from a structural decline where not much can be done really, the tide goes down and takes every ship down with it. BUT, this can be dangerous when a company is executing on the business plan and has positive developments.

This year we had 2 catalysts that showed what can happen when ASTS keeps executing on the business plan.

1. On March 9, 2022 the news came out that ASTS partnered with SpaceX to deliver their satellites to space. That proved ASTS is meaningfully moving forward with its objectives, and resulted in a ferocious seller covering rally that day, where just ‚Äúriding with tide‚Äù as a seller backfired massively. ASTS stock almost doubled in a day: from lows of $6.20 to highs of $11.40. Later, macro pressures set in again, pushing ASTS lower and the ‚Äúeasy‚Äù bear trade came back in, sinking all high risk assets.
2. On July 28, 2022 yet another positive news momentum came in with BW3 satellite launch, that forced a lot of sellers to get out of the way. The frenzied rally more than doubled the stock price in a few weeks. Price went from $6.20 to $14.20, then received expected push back and yielded with broad market weakness.

After Kerrisdale released their bearish report in mid-September price nose dived and we visited the $6 ‚Äúsupport area‚Äù and bottom of the channel. Interesting to note that previous 2 times, the stock launched from around $6.20.

I think right now there is little idiosyncratic movement to the stock, mostly macro pushing it lower, but that is about to change. Now is an optimal time to get in because we are the bottom of the channel and 3 massive catalysts are upcoming next week, hopefully aided by the tailwinds from macro (not guaranteed) and pressures from sellers relenting as company executes.

# 5/ The New LONG Trade and Upcoming Catalysts

We have an ER update call on Monday, November 14. The three main events will serve as proof of company execution and are likely to push the price up in the next few weeks.

1. Unfurling of the BW3 satellite is going to happen on November 10. Successful completion is likely to serve as a big catalyst to the stock. Satellite will open up and become operational and ready for testing.

[Furled](https://preview.redd.it/5y3wecosqsx91.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd2ae1d0649d74a9db5fe749c1856a6d70bd0d6e)

[Unfurled](https://preview.redd.it/ew43yfytqsx91.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=916c4d08e26af04ecfd10f47c8a29ee23fe2dce1)

2. Testing of the satellite should happen shortly thereafter and an announcement confirmation of working technology is going to be an even larger event for ASTS. This will be the proof that technology works with MNOs.

3. Other funding or partnership updates, like 5G Fund providing indication of possible financing to ASTS may happen by the end of the year, as well as getting licenses in new jurisdictions (Japan), or more partnerships with MNOs.

[Comments on ASTS eligibility for being financed by FCC's 5G Fund](https://preview.redd.it/g1iknnuvqsx91.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=83b7a48437c40c0dc87d4b6a3f9a2ab964afeb4f)

One of the arguments of sellers is that company will need additional funding before generating meaningful free cash flow. Currently they do have runway to revenue, and that gets even better if the FCC 5G fund awards capital to ASTS or if price stays at $18+ for a month, where warrants become redeemable for $200M of capital. Moreover, there‚Äôs other non-dilutive financing options, but regardless I think they‚Äôll be explored in second half of 2023 or later.

&#x200B;

[From spacanpanman](https://preview.redd.it/co5m5bc0rsx91.png?width=1194&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a1991c6fc6b4ae4c8fef5e73a7840c35434eeac)

The reason why I think the moves up on positive news could be violent is because there will be additional buying pressure from bearish traders to get cover their positions in face of good data.

Once ASTS confirms that these events are successful, stock will likely become favored by passive and risk-averse investors, with institutional funds buying in and momentum/breakout traders scaling into positions. I believe we‚Äôll get to $14 area if updates are positive, and a breakout above that is likely to clean the path to $18+ which I think is going to be the turning point for the company, that will set it up for long term success.

[ASTS 1D timeframe, imaginary price action.](https://preview.redd.it/wrcwev02ssx91.png?width=1814&format=png&auto=webp&s=c19d086660cb232eff0c4b823b17f25bc91d5f2d)

Disclaimer, Risks:

Past performance is not indicative of future results. This is not financial advice. There are risks of company failing and stock going to zero.

TLDR:

The no brainer trade this year was to short unprofitable technology and just sit tight. But it is dangerous now, especially on a company like ASTS, which is a powder keg that can explode on successful business developments that are to be announced on November 10 and shortly after. Three upcoming catalysts are likely to serve as a repeat of price action in March and August. Although price is artificially suppressed by the macro environment, once that pressure subsides, the stock will stay high and keep pushing forward as company executes.

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&format=png&auto=webp&s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is > 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November.

A few weeks back, I mentioned the bounce was coming here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading\_spy\_next\_9\_days/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xwd4zs/trading_spy_next_9_days/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)  and here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading\_spy\_week\_of\_oct\_17th/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y6fd2y/trading_spy_week_of_oct_17th/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).  

Lets review the chart:

https://preview.redd.it/simrw4hgs6x91.png?width=1621&format=png&auto=webp&s=b99051cb337956bd26751615fd147f7829826e08

A few points to note, the ""**oversold we are too bearish"" sentiment has faded**. Notice the RSI. 

Equities are basically **priced in the same place as two rate hikes ago**. Has macro improved? No. Have earnings improved? No.

What did POW say he was going to do? Cause pain. **Has there been pain yet? No**. Is unemployment higher? No. 

What about inflation, is it subsiding? No. **Remember the CPI report? It was awful.** Sure PCE wasn't as hot, but it wasn't cool enough. 

Is the FED data dependent? Yes. Is there data based on historical data with lag? Yes. **Has that historical data improved? No**, not really. 

What about midterms? Yes it feels like there was a midterm pump with the dems trying to keep power by keeping gas prices low and stock prices high. **Is that what POW wants? No**, it isn't. Is there some pump left in the tank? Maybe, but the pumpers will be fine dumping if they get underwater. 

Will POW bend at the knee to the politicians? I don't think so. He was able to stand Trump's tirades, he can certainly stand Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Pelosi. Yes, he ultimately pivoted in 2018, but this is NOT 2018. **The guy isn't worried about job security,** he wants to be ""the man"" to solve this problem. 

**Have earnings improved? No,** not in the slightest. Have the real reductions in earnings, or forward looking earnings come down? No, not in a significant way. 

Did Apple have a great quarter? Not really, it was basically as expected, and yet it had the best day in years up 7% - just for being not as bad as its peers (FAANG). **Apple can't save the market single handedly.** 

Did the **mega cap tech stocks shit the bed? Yes they did.** Did the market go down? No it didn't. 

Is the **DOW going to lead us out of a recession? No.** KO and the boomer companies don't have the market cap or retail/institutional interest to lift the entire market. 

Why did we rally? **Historic put buying was ""closed"" and historic ""bearishness"" was closed for a profit.** Notice the ridiculous shape of the up moves in stocks and in SPY - those are MARKET orders, not normal accumulation. Those are people closing shorts or traders - not investors accumulating long term positions. **Paper hands in means paper hands out.** 

**340 is the pre-covid high, expect a big bounce there** as many people will close their shorts and close their puts at that level, triggering the next bear market rally. 

For some reason, the likely hood of a .50 hike (instead of .75) has increased. This sets us up more for disappointment to the downside as opposed to a surprise to the upside. Keep in mind, even if POW does .50 the only reason he would do that is because the FED predicts the economy to be significantly damaged and that the impending recession will be significant enough to reign in inflation. Meaning - shit is so bad out there that we only need .50. It is counter intuitive but no mater how you slice it, **the future of the markets and the economy look bleak.** 

Counter point: **if POW is dovish at all, or only does .50 then the market will moon.** There is no other counterpoint or no other macro that will drive the next up move other than the position of the FED.   


**How to Trade It:**  


* With the VIX ""relatively low"" compared to the past month of action, it is acceptable to buy puts here. Volatility and pricing is finally on the side of going long on puts. 
* I see spy quite easily testing the 348 low it established earlier this month. It's going to happen faster than expected, just as fast as this recent Bear Market Rally. 
* Buy puts now, probably the 330P expiring late November. Hold those puts until the low is tested around 350.
* Before the FOMC press conference, VIX will likely spike up regardless of where the market moves. Sell the 360/370 call spread expiring late November. 
* Once the market declines to roughly the 350 level on spy, and VIX is > 35, sell the 340P creating a bull put spread. 
* The combination of your sold calls (get them tomorrow pre FOMC) and the newly created put credit spread will lock in your gains and give you a ""free"" shot at max gain assuming SPY stays between 340 and 360 in late November. 

What other macro trends do you think I missed? 

PS. if you don't want to short the market, short TSLA. Its the most obvious play out there.

# $2k to $100k Challenge Update

For those of you who dont know, im 17 trading days in challenge where i trade live everyday, starting with $2k (actually $1.8k) and trade my way to $100k, live in front of everyone everyday.

**Options Starting Amount:** $1000

**Day 17 Closing Amount:** $5038

**Port % Change:** 400%  
**Proof:**

https://preview.redd.it/m7dh205b10x91.jpg?width=1633&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5ecf4dece8117c832473836daf9665ea89ced868

**Futures/Commodities Starting Amount:** $800

**Day 17 Closing Amount:** $1500

**Port % Change**: %87.5

I found that people for the most are not really interested in Global/Futures plays, but if you guys want i can definitely add that to the watchlist next week. Let me know in the comments.

This week we gained big by predicting 2 main moves, the drop on the GDP release, we ran on very bad news for Feds, the drop was inevitable. And another big gainer was PCE release, got in PM into SPX calls when i saw Bullish divergence between price action and RSI and added size after PCE meet expectation as it was good news for the Feds and PCE is one of powells favorite metrics to look at for rate hikes.

The following is basically my plan for next week.

# Major Economic Events

**Monday 10/31**

9:45 AM Chicago PMI

10:00 AM Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index Oct

**Tuesday 11/01**

9:45 AM S&P Global PMI Final Oct

10:00 AM ISM Manufacturing PMI Oct

10:00 AM Jolts Job Openings Sep

**Wednesday 11/02**

8:15 AM ADP Employment Change Oct

2:00 PM Fed Interest Rate Decision

2:30 PM Fed Press Conference

**Thursday 11/03**

8:30 AM Balance of Trade Sep

10:00 AM ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI Oct

**Friday 11/04**

8:30 AM Non Farm Payroll Oct

8:30 AM Unemployment Rate Oct

So all these are very important events that will move the market, but the offcourse the important event is the Fed Conference on wednesday which is the only event ill playing.

So my play here is in 2 parts.

Part 1 - The Rate Hike

Believe it or not the rate hike is not that important and is unlikely to affect the market that much, let me explain.

https://preview.redd.it/owgfdped10x91.png?width=1262&format=png&auto=webp&s=a466d5bcb721e09c65cc449128a726a17b262b77

As of Friday 28Oct the market is pricing

0% chance of 100Bps

81.3% chance of 75Bps

18.7% chance of 50Bps

Now in my previous watchlist we have been predicting the rate hikes right every single time by just following the highest odds, the Fed doesnt like to freak the market. They also dont want the market to rally too much so its also unlikely that we get 50Bps, in addition to that why do 50Bps when they can get away with 75Bps without freaking out the market.

In all cases, they definitely not doing 100bps, if they do 75bps as expected we run a little (ill tell why a little later on) if they 50Bps we run alot. It seems to me for the first part the very obvious play here is calls before the rate hike, and sell on the spike for that delicious IV spiked premium.

Part 2 - The Meeting

Well this is where it gets very tricky, so as you may know that market has been rallying lately and thats because alot of people are expecting the Fed to pivot, or at least start talking about pivoting this time.

If they say we are pivoting the run continues at least till we hit the 200MA on the SPX 1D chart, if they we cant do that yet, we are getting new 52 week lows.

This part is easy to figure the part is figuring out whether they will pivot or not, for funsies ill give you my expectations, but honeslty im going to play it by ear. Im 50/50 on what they plan to do, and the move will be so big you can get in at time and still make $$, you can also do a straddle.

Anyway Looking at the PCE report inflation is not so bad, thats why ran hard after the report was out, its not the best report in the world, but its an improvement for sure, add to that the St. Louis Fed came out with report stating the Fed is wrong to look only at CPI as it is lagging data heavily weight down with rent prices going up and that if we remove rent, inflation has actually cooled off and we are actually deflating now.

The fed doesnt want to risk deflation by forcing a recession when we dont really need to. (This is a much worse scenario than inflation, thats why the Fed is being careful)

On the other hand, GDP came out pretty damn positive, the so called earnings recession and end of the world stock market destruction is nowhere to be seen. While some growth tech companies ‚Äò‚Äômissed‚Äô‚Äô (most of them just lowered guidance, they didnt actually miss) most of the not so sexy companies beat. This is good for the stock market, VERY bad for the feds, this means that demand is not getting crushed, and if demand is high, prices will likely remain elevated. So all this might signal to the Fed that job not done yet, we need more pain.

As you can see there are very good reasons for the Fed to go either way, i think we get a pivot for an important reason no one is really talking about. The US treasuries the most liquid market in the world, is losing its liquidity. With UK and Japan selling US Treasures to prop up their currienses and markets and the Fed tightening and no longer buying assets this is starting to affect the treasuries market.

Guys if treasure market goes no bid or crashes, 2008 + 2001 + Great depression will NOT even come close to the global collapse that we might experience. Central Banks Chairs around the world have been pestering Powell about that recently. I think they will do anything to make sure that doesnt happen.

But like i said we shall see.

# Watchlist

**- $TSLA Long**

https://preview.redd.it/xf5d6mcf10x91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0ee3eae96a82cee42fcf3f93488dfd70d3e66a5

If TSLA continues its run, and finally break the 230 resistance, we can easily see a run to $250 level, will take calls on Monday

**- $SPY Short**

https://preview.redd.it/q96wt5pg10x91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=278dc0bbd5025aca467cb822a03603f7ecd7a914

Whether we run or not after FOMC the 1Hr is VERY over extended, and we are due a pullback, its not going to be a sharp one likely but still could make for a nice trade.

**- $PIN Long**

https://preview.redd.it/em2jx6hh10x91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=754fa108ef21a21dc4a22bb0b10c6c4d855fd71c

Strong beat by PINS still has room for more if it breaks the $25.9 resistance we can get $27.95, quickly, taking some call here for a possible run

**- $DB Short**

https://preview.redd.it/bt550y5i10x91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=20ba5802ea52e0d4b92c01b6f45dd1e765f2b507

Ran so much on that earnings beat, creating a short gap fill to $9.5. Its also very Overbought on the Daily chart making a nice %3 move down at least, picking up some puts as long as it doesnt move down before the open

# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play

Alright boys and girls so played this one before as 10 bagger and we got our 10 bag (and then some) But this one has more left in the tank for another run.

Its NFLX baby.

So we ran hard before and on earnings securing our 10 bag ( This was my firs 10bag call on my first watchlist, check my profile for proof).

Now it crossed the 200MA on the daily chart after filling half the gap so take a little rest. What we are looking for here is for NFLX to reclaims 50 and 21MA  on the 1hr time frame. Once we get we reclaim that we will continue to fill the remainder of the gap fill all the way to $330

Alright, so that's it for this week, ill be doing this every week and going through the previous week‚Äôs play to see how much we gained and where we went wrong.

The fed doesnt want to risk deflation by forcing a recession when we dont really need to. (This is a much worse scenario than inflation, thats why the Fed is being careful)

On the other hand, GDP came out pretty damn positive, the so called earnings recession and end of the world stock market destruction is nowhere to be seen. While some growth tech companies ‚Äò‚Äômissed‚Äô‚Äô (most of them just lowered guidance, they didnt actually miss) most of the not so sexy companies beat. This is good for the stock market, VERY bad for the feds, this means that demand is not getting crushed, and if demand is high, prices will likely remain elevated. So all this might signal to the Fed that job not done yet, we need more pain.

As you can see there are very good reasons for the Fed to go either way, i think we get a pivot for an important reason no one is really talking about. The US treasuries the most liquid market in the world, is losing its liquidity. With UK and Japan selling US Treasures to prop up their currienses and markets and the Fed tightening and no longer buying assets this is starting to affect the treasuries market.

Guys if treasure market goes no bid or crashes, 2008 + 2001 + Great depression will NOT even come close to the global collapse that we might experience. Central Banks Chairs around the world have been pestering Powell about that recently. I think they will do anything to make sure that doesnt happen.

But like i said we shall see.

# Watchlist

**- $TSLA Long**

https://preview.redd.it/xf5d6mcf10x91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0ee3eae96a82cee42fcf3f93488dfd70d3e66a5

If TSLA continues its run, and finally break the 230 resistance, we can easily see a run to $250 level, will take calls on Monday

**- $SPY Short**

https://preview.redd.it/q96wt5pg10x91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=278dc0bbd5025aca467cb822a03603f7ecd7a914

Whether we run or not after FOMC the 1Hr is VERY over extended, and we are due a pullback, its not going to be a sharp one likely but still could make for a nice trade.

**- $PIN Long**

https://preview.redd.it/em2jx6hh10x91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=754fa108ef21a21dc4a22bb0b10c6c4d855fd71c

Strong beat by PINS still has room for more if it breaks the $25.9 resistance we can get $27.95, quickly, taking some call here for a possible run

**- $DB Short**

https://preview.redd.it/bt550y5i10x91.png?width=1488&format=png&auto=webp&s=20ba5802ea52e0d4b92c01b6f45dd1e765f2b507

Ran so much on that earnings beat, creating a short gap fill to $9.5. Its also very Overbought on the Daily chart making a nice %3 move down at least, picking up some puts as long as it doesnt move down before the open

# Bonus Potential 10 Bagger Play

Alright boys and girls so played this one before as 10 bagger and we got our 10 bag (and then some) But this one has more left in the tank for another run.

Its NFLX baby.

So we ran hard before and on earnings securing our 10 bag ( This was my firs 10bag call on my first watchlist, check my profile for proof).

Now it crossed the 200MA on the daily chart after filling half the gap so take a little rest. What we are looking for here is for NFLX to reclaims 50 and 21MA  on the 1hr time frame. Once we get we reclaim that we will continue to fill the remainder of the gap fill all the way to $330

Lets say theoretically everyone on the planet wanted to buy a Tesla.. Regardless of that demand, Tesla's limiting factor is currently the supply side, and can only get worse. I haven't even mentioned the competition from other automakers now in the EV space, imagine all the big automakers scrambling more than they are now for lithium.

**Character**: With all that being said, he is kind of an annoying human. If he wasn't rich, wasn't good at engineering, wasn't changing the world, no one would like him personally. Mother of his children and x wife is all the character reference you need. 

**Interest Rates:** With the interest rate environment drastically different, and the TSLA bros starting to get underwater, his magic touch is wearing off. Just look at the TSLA chart YTD and try to feel positive about that. You can't. 

**Comps**: Kanye was the greatest rapper of all time. Trump was the greatest president of all time (not saying I agree, but some do). Elon is the greatest engineer of all time. No one really cares about their accomplishments if they don't comply with the social fabric of the new woke left America. It really doesn't matter about facts, only about feels. Not sure Elon gives people the good vibes he used to. Trump, Kanye, Elon are the three free speech musketeers - two out of these three are officially cancelled already. 

**Annoying**: Sink into twitter is a bitch move. It mocks the establishment, mocks the left. He threatens to fire 75% of the staff - even if they deserve it, this is a very ""non left"" thing to do. 

**Women**: He keeps impregnating women and then leaving them. Lefties don't like that. He impregnates his employees as well. I am sure there are some settlements out there he has made, or an abortion he paid for, just a matter of time until someone attacks him. 

**Anti-Vax Narative:** He is anti vax in some regard. He believes in science for sure, but isn't afraid to criticize WHO, Fauci, Biden, The Government, Big Pharma or other players on the left. 

**Capitalism is Bad Now:** He is anti worker, pro capitalist. Expects people to sleep in the factory, return to work, do his bidding or be unemployed. 

**Big Tech is Bad Now:** Both left and right hate ‚Äúbig tech‚Äù - this is one of the only things that politicians agree on. Social media is bad, consumer privacy should be protected, tech companies shouldn't have more power than politicians. 

**Disrespects the Government:** He smokes weed on Joe Rohan with privileged defense contracts. This is just another disrespectful move to bite the hand that feeds him. He shits on Biden, Biden shits on him. Elon drops memes like he is 14 years old mocking the establishment, and he has a very large following - that makes him a target. 

**Indian Giver:** He demands the Gov pay for his starlink service for ukraine when the gov, nor ukraine, never asked him to save the day like that. You don't invite your friend to dinner, then complain and ask them to pay for it after the fact. Indian giving is a bitch move. 

**Conspiracy Theorist:** He promotes Russel Brands youtube channel. Sure MSM is total bullshit, but that doesn't make RB a source of truth. If you promote stuff like that, you are playing for the wrong team. The team that gets cancelled.  

**\[Redacted\]:** His is king of ""that which can't be named here"" the bros are and their coins are not doing so hot right now. Powell actively wants them gone. The social media influencers who promoted these pump and dump coins are facing their time in court, Elon is the main dude pumping.

**Not Green Enough:** The ""green"" left is starting to be alienated by Elon specifically. He is too rich, too successful, to capitalist. Lets not forget the cars themselves are not exactly ""green"" to produce and the whole idea of EVs being ""more green"" than ICE cars is a u argument that doesn't stand up to scrutiny. 

**Lack of Immunity:** He doesn't have ""founder control"" of TSLA. He actually can be removed, not saying he will or that he should, just stating it is possible. 

**False Promises:** He has a pending FSD lawsuit because - well, FSD is a complete lie. Its not even close and yet it is marketed AND SOLD as available. Many hundreds of thousands of people paid 10k for FSD, and it simply doesn't exist.  Where is the cyber truck? What is the deal with a robot 10 years behind Boston Dynamics and Honda? Bullet proof glass? Semi truck deliveries? Bigger than Apple and Aramco? 

**Free Speech:** The Twitter purchase removes the ""town square"" from the free speech arena. It is now private speech, controlled by one individual. It's also a huge distraction to his more meaningful missions at SpaceX, Tesla, Starlink, Boring Co etc - this alienates his investors and bankers across the ""real"" companies as he spends his time fixing the dumpster fires at a shit company.

I have a Tesla, its a great car. I have starlink. I want people to go to Mars. Personally, I fully support Elon and couldn't care less what type of ""person"" he is - but that is not the climate we are in today.

It's also a huge distraction to his more meaningful missions at SpaceX, Tesla, Starlink, Boring Co etc - this alienates his investors and bankers across the ""real"" companies as he spends his time fixing the dumpster fires at a shit company.  

I had another post on [TSLA as a stock losing its growth trajectory](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y1dtf7/tsla_is_dying/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and I recommended [everyone sell calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/y8ehch/tesla_just_ended_the_rally/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) which everyone criticized but turned into gains for me. 

I have a Tesla, its a great car. I have starlink. I want people to go to Mars. Personally, I fully support Elon and couldn't care less what type of ""person"" he is - but that is not the climate we are in today. 

What do you guys think the chances are of Elon being socially ""cancelled"" - or there at least being an attempt - in the next 12 months? Is his popularity and influence fading along with his market cap? Can Elon be cancelled?",-13.19

47,TSLA,1666801602.0,Mobileye IPO already up over 30% today. INTC is permanently keeping 400m shares basically assigning .1 MBLY share to every INTC share.,"Because INTC is keeping 50% of all Mobileye shares long term, that means they will keep 400 million shares  for their shareholders (~800m total shares, although for now they still own 95% - they may eventually offload the 45% if the value and demand is there).

 there are 4 billion INTC shares, so **each share is basically assigned 0.1 mobileye share, or every 10 intel shares includes 1 full mobileye share.**

So INTC share price is really discounted by 10% of a mobileye share. eg Mobileye at $28 means that an INTC share is worth $2.8 of mobileye value, so at the current price of $27.5, the MBLY part is $2.8 and the INTC part is $24.7 (MBLY at current cheap prices is worth 11.33% of an INTC share price).

Once you factor in  the dividend for the INTC part only because MBLY doesnt pay a dividend, it gets even better. Its great the market can now assign some value to INTC assets instead of ignoring them, or guessing random amounts. If MBLY increases it might reach over 25% of each INTC share dollar weighting at some point.

Lastly a large increase in MBLY will bring in lots of capital to INTC when they sell another 45% of the company, which they will only do if the price shoots up and has large demand. 

Maybe even Elon will secretly buy some as TSLA self driving is more like human driving with some aids and hes slowed down on making false promises to his shareholders about it recently.","Mobileye IPO already up over 30% today.

Recently I've just been trying to get quick scalps here and there with this crazy market movement. I have a margin account where I typically keep an all cash position to trade with. Day traded yesterday all day and I didn't have one red trade. ( I've had days where I've only had red trades but yesterday just happened to click and work for me)

So yesterday I had an all cash position into market close. I bought a position after market when things were tanking (specifically $TSLA at 217.30 and I sold at 4 am in premarket at 219.30) 100 shares both ways. so I profited $200 on the overnight trade.

But when I closed my position in the early hours of the morning I noticed that my account was misrepresenting P/L by a lot it showed that I had overall gains and losses that were different from my actual P/L. Although the monetary value in my account did not reflect that (it was more or less correct my balance was close to where it ought to be so I figured it was a bug) The glitches later cleared up after I went to sleep and woke up again.

But when I woke up I had a negative -$300ish P/L for the day, although the only trade I had made had granted me +$200

Is it possible for this to happen? I contacted support and he explained it but I don't know I just still didn't get it. I don't understand how could be mathematically possible but I just wanted to run it by you guys to see if that this is usual?

""While initial signs of a slowing consumer present itself in shrinking order-to-delivery times/reduced order backlots, we believe Tesla‚Äôs increasingly large size today and in the forecast makes it susceptible to what could be some profound swings in consumer strength and EV affordability,"" updated analyst Adam Jonas.

Morgan Stanley pulled in its automotive gross margin and cash flow for Tesla (TSLA) to account some of the headwinds, including ramping two Gigafactories on separate continents.

On capital allocation, Jonas said the firm is not enthusiastic about share buybacks from TSLA given the other growth opportunities the electric vehicle maker has at its disposal and the importance of building up cash reserves to maintain a self-financing status throughout a range of uncertain economic environments.

75,TSLA,1666614932.0,Tesla shares down 3% in premarket after Elon Musk‚Äôs EV firm cuts price of cars in China," 

[Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) shares slipped in premarket trade Monday after the company cut the price of some of its cars in China.

Shares of the electric car maker were down around 3% in New York before the market open.

Tesla slashed the price of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in China, one of the company's most critical markets.

The starting price for the¬†Model¬†3 sedan was reduced to 265,900 Chinese yuan ($36,615) from 279,900 yuan. The Model Y sports utility vehicle now costs 288,900 yuan versus the previous price of 316,900 yuan.

Tesla's cuts partly reverse some of the price increases the company was [forced to carry out earlier this year in China and the U.S.](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/15/tesla-hikes-car-prices-in-the-us-china-after-musk-inflation-warning.html) on the back of rising raw material costs.

 

[Elon Musk](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/), CEO of Tesla, [warned in March](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/17/tesla-hikes-china-made-model-y-price-again-by-more-than-2000.html) that his electric car company is ""seeing significant recent inflation pressure in raw materials & logistics.""

The price cuts also come after Musk said he sees elements of a recession in China.

""China is experiencing a recession of sorts"" mostly in the property markets, Musk said last week.

Tesla¬†[delivered](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/02/tesla-tsla-q3-2022-vehicle-delivery-and-production-numbers.html) 343,000 vehicles for the quarter ended Sept. 30, missing analyst expectations. The company does not break out how many cars were delivered in China. Tesla also [missed analyst expectation on revenue in the third quarter](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/19/tesla-tsla-earnings-q3-2022-.html).

However in September, the China¬†Passenger Car Association reported Tesla delivered 83,135¬†China-made¬†electric vehicles, a monthly record for the company. Tesla has a huge Gigafactory in the Chinese city of Shanghai which it completed upgrades on earlier this year.

Still, the price cuts come in the [face of rising competition](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/18/byd-shares-jump-after-chinese-ev-maker-forecasts-surging-profits.html) for Tesla in China from domestic firms such as Warren Buffett-backed [BYD](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/1211-HK/) as well as upstarts [Nio](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NIO/) and [Xpeng](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XPEV/).

Other electric car makers have [hiked prices this year](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/electric-carmakers-in-china-hike-prices-on-rising-material-costs-.html) including BYD and Xpeng, as rising raw material costs hit these companies.

The Chinese economy keeps facing challenges particularly as strict [Covid-19](https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/) controls continue to weigh on retail sales. [Third-quarter gross domestic product rose 3.9%](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/24/china-third-quarter-gdp.html) from a year ago, beating expectations, but remaining below the official target of around 5.5% growth.","Tesla shares down 3% in premarket after Elon Musk‚Äôs EV firm cuts price of cars in China

[Elon Musk](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/), CEO of Tesla, [warned in March](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/17/tesla-hikes-china-made-model-y-price-again-by-more-than-2000.html) that his electric car company is ""seeing significant recent inflation pressure in raw materials & logistics.""

The price cuts also come after Musk said he sees elements of a recession in China.

""China is experiencing a recession of sorts"" mostly in the property markets, Musk said last week.

Tesla¬†[delivered](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/02/tesla-tsla-q3-2022-vehicle-delivery-and-production-numbers.html) 343,000 vehicles for the quarter ended Sept. 30, missing analyst expectations. The company does not break out how many cars were delivered in China. Tesla also [missed analyst expectation on revenue in the third quarter](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/19/tesla-tsla-earnings-q3-2022-.html).

However in September, the China¬†Passenger Car Association reported Tesla delivered 83,135¬†China-made¬†electric vehicles, a monthly record for the company. Tesla has a huge Gigafactory in the Chinese city of Shanghai which it completed upgrades on earlier this year.

Still, the price cuts come in the [face of rising competition](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/18/byd-shares-jump-after-chinese-ev-maker-forecasts-surging-profits.html) for Tesla in China from domestic firms such as Warren Buffett-backed [BYD](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/1211-HK/) as well as upstarts [Nio](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NIO/) and [Xpeng](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XPEV/).

Other electric car makers have [hiked prices this year](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/25/electric-carmakers-in-china-hike-prices-on-rising-material-costs-.html) including BYD and Xpeng, as rising raw material costs hit these companies.

The Chinese economy keeps facing challenges particularly as strict [Covid-19](https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/) controls continue to weigh on retail sales. [Third-quarter gross domestic product rose 3.9%](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/24/china-third-quarter-gdp.html) from a year ago, beating expectations, but remaining below the official target of around 5.5% growth.",0.0

Wall Street is in for a hectic last week of October as some of the market‚Äôs most heavily-weighted companies report financial results and the government releases its quarterly scorecard of the U.S. economy‚Äôs health.

On the earnings front, tech giants Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT&.tsrc=fin-srch)), Alphabet ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL)), Meta Platforms ([FB](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB)), Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL)), and Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) ‚Äì which alone represent roughly a quarter of the S&P 500 index ‚Äì will be the most closely watched names of the earnings season among 165 corporations scheduled to release figures.

A bevy of economic reports will also keep investors busy, with a preliminary reading of third-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) due out Thursday taking top billing. Economists expect the advance estimate to show the U.S. economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.3% last quarter after back-to-back contractions in Q1 and Q2, per consensus estimates from Bloomberg.

 

Earnings that have so far come in better-than-feared helped power the major averages toward [weekly gains of roughly 5% for each index on Friday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-news-live-updates-october-21-2022-110339121.html), the best five-day performance since June for the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq. Fedspeak that signaled officials [may discuss slowing the magnitude of interest rate hikes](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-daly-says-time-start-180309530.html) at the end of this year also stoked optimism among investors.

For this quarter, the number of S&P 500 reporting positive earnings surprises and the magnitude of those estimate beats remain below their 5-year and 10-year averages, according to [data from FactSet Research](https://insight.factset.com/sp-500-earnings-season-update-october-21-2022). But the earnings growth rate for the third quarter has improved in the past week compared to the prior.

Earnings from tech heavyweights Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA)) and Snap ([SNAP](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SNAP)) didn‚Äôt leave much hope that their sector peers may continue that trend in the week ahead, with [Tesla‚Äôs revenue disappointing analysts](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-q-2-earnings-124821562.html) and Snap [unveiling its smallest revenue increase](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/snap-stock-is-crashing-again-3-big-problems-still-lurk-102202548.html) since its 2017 IPO.

On Tuesday, Google parent company Alphabet will be the first of technology behemoths to report. Analysts have warned that macro issues such as negative currency headwinds are likely to drive down growth rates for the companies, along with others in the mega-cap tech lineup.

Strength in the [U.S. dollar has hit companies hard](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/king-dollar-is-making-a-royal-feast-of-corporate-earnings-morning-brief-100033429.html), with strategists at Citigroup estimating that the greenback‚Äôs 10% bump will cut $15 to $20 from S&P 500 earnings per share. The [dollar index](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DX-Y.NYB?p=DX-Y.NYB&.tsrc=fin-srch) has surged more than 17% [against a basket of other currencies](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-the-strong-us-dollar-so-strong-134038886.html), including the euro and the yen. For U.S. companies, this means that any revenues from overseas will be reduced when converted back to dollars.

That headwind is expected to show up in Amazon‚Äôs results on Thursday, given that roughly 30% of the e-commerce conglomerate‚Äôs revenues internationally derived, per estimates from CFRA research. Same goes for Microsoft, with analysts at Goldman Sachs warning that ‚Äúforeign exchange headwinds continue to be overhangs"" even as demand is likely to remain healthy across commercial offerings from the company for its PCs and cloud services.

  

For Apple, momentum in iPhone demand will be one of the biggest factors monitored by stock-watchers. Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring in a recent note predicted ‚Äúdemand has held up better than expected in recent months.‚Äù

Meta and Twitter ([TWTR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR)) will also report on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively, as part of tech‚Äôs 72-hour earnings rollout.

Other notable financial results on tap include the Coca-Cola ([KO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KO)), General Electric ([GE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GE)), General Motors ([GM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM)), Ford Motor ([F](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F)), Comcast ([CMCSA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CMCSA)), Visa ([V](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/V)), Mastercard ([MA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MA)), and Exxon Mobil ([XOM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XOM)), among others.

In economic data, GDP data is expected to show the U.S. economy grew last quarter after two straight negative quarterly readings ‚Äì which met the textbook definition of a recession, even as the government said the NBER‚Äôs panel of economists must officially declare a recession.

Economic releases on the calendar for the week also consist of the S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index, new and pending home sales data, and the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index.

 

According to Pantheon Economics‚Äô Chief Economist Ian Shepherdson, the anticipated rebound in GDP, the broadest measure of economic activity, is attributed to a comeback in net exports, correction from plunges in the first and second quarters, and technical factors lifting the inventory numbers.

‚ÄúBut the outlook for the first half of next year has materially darkened, and the chance of a brief recession has increased, thanks to the substantial and broad tightening of financial conditions,‚Äù Shepherdson added, citing higher rates across the curve, widening corporate spreads, falling stock prices, the emerging rollover in home prices, and the strong dollar.","Yahoo Finance Big Tech earnings and GDP data

It designs, develops, manufactures, leases, and sells electric vehicles, as well as energy generation and storage systems in the United States, China, and internationally. 

&#x200B;

The company as of 21 October 2022 is valued at $649.51bn, although shares have fallen from $400 to $215 since the start of the year. 

&#x200B;

Their Q3 for the year was released on 19 October 2022.

&#x200B;

Revenue was up 56% to $21,454m (compared to last year), while net profit was up 103.5% to $3,292m. This means its net margin improved from 11.8% to 15.3%. 

&#x200B;

The short-term liquidity (current liabilities/current assets) of Tesla is high, at a current rate of 68.4%, despite improving from 72.2% this time last year. Investors will want to see this rate drop below 50% as soon as possible and show a tighter control of liabilities. Rising interest rates will not coincide well for company's with high liabilities, although rising net profit margins may provide optimism that its liquidity will continue improving. 

&#x200B;

Current assets increased 44% to $35,990m, while current liabilities increased 36.3% to $24,611m. 

&#x200B;

Tesla's long-term liquidity (total liabilities/total assets) is at a much healthier rate than its short-term liquidity, having dipped to 46.5% in the Q3. This shows that the company is in a tighter financial position in the short-term period (one year), than its long-term.  

&#x200B;

Total assets increased 28.7% to $74,426m since last year, while total liabilities were up at a slower rate of 12.3% to $34,575m. Long-term liquidity has improved from 53.2% to 46.5% during that timeframe. 

&#x200B;

Total cash levels have also been steadily increasing since last year, which is impressive when liquidity is simultaneously decreasing, which again may be thanks to rising net profit margins. Total cash increased 31.1% to $21,107m, which made up 61.1% of the company's total liabilities.

My reason for yolo? Well i'm a long term bull, but Tesla is down 33% because of of fucking twitter? With NO rebound. If we consider the macro, NASDAQ & SPY only down 15% in same period so this is all bullshit. Everyone literally **knows** Tesla will execute on a $30k car at scale with high margins and everyone knows at least ONE of his many startups (FSD, Optimus etc) will be realised. I really do believe, everyone is ""playing along"" to bring the price down JUST to buy in cheaper because they missed the boat in 2020, all while everyone else still has plausible deniability that this *might not be* a generational company, so AS SOON AS Twitter pressure lefts next friday, this thing will explode to the upside.

... I admit this thought process may be completely regarded. If Elon starts selling next week I will have to come to terms with the fact that my position will say something crazy like -50% and I will not sleep easy next week. I will have to hold until afterwards because then the price *should* skyrocket immediately after. So this literally cannot go tits up as long as I have the balls to hodl

I held this all week and was screaming the whole time post-earnings as my position was down -¬£30k. (on a TSLA -7% move)

My reason for yolo? Well i'm a long term bull, but Tesla is down 33% because of of fucking twitter? With NO rebound. If we consider the macro, NASDAQ & SPY only down 15% in same period so this is all bullshit. Everyone literally **knows** Tesla will execute on a $30k car at scale with high margins and everyone knows at least ONE of his many startups (FSD, Optimus etc) will be realised. I really do believe, everyone is ""playing along"" to bring the price down JUST to buy in cheaper because they missed the boat in 2020, all while everyone else still has plausible deniability that this *might not be* a generational company, so AS SOON AS Twitter pressure lefts next friday, this thing will explode to the upside.

... I admit this thought process may be completely regarded. If Elon starts selling next week I will have to come to terms with the fact that my position will say something crazy like -50% and I will not sleep easy next week. I will have to hold until afterwards because then the price *should* skyrocket immediately after. So this literally cannot go tits up as long as I have the balls to hodl

If nothing else, everyone is buying PUTS into next week and expects the price to fall, so always do the opposite, fuck it

89,TSLA,1666494426.0,"In my early 20s, need some advice","I've just recently finished university and working full time now. In 2021 to early part of 2022, I had around 10k saved from the previous 4 years working internships and summer jobs, and I started investing during that time and as many others, I lost legit all of it.   


For a long time, almost all of 2022, I just didn't even want to look at any of this anymore, was so burnt out. But now I've started work full time and I have money I should be looking to invest, and I think it's a good time to do so for my future.  


Currently, I have around 15k I can invest and per month I can squeeze out around 500 to continuously invest.  


I want to have a fresh start, and this time make some more smarter decisions. I've spent some time to compile a list of companies from different sectors I could star to look into which maybe good opportunities:

**TECH**:  
GOOG  
FB  
MSFT  
APPL  
TSLA  
NVDA  
Amd  
Shop  
Snap

**Consumer Goods**  
PG  
WMT  
ACI  
MCD  
JNJ  
NKE

**Finance and Banking**  
V  
MA  
TD / BMO / RY (Canadian Banks)

**ETFs**  
QQQ  
FNGU  
ARKF  
XEQT  


**Others**  
BRK-B  
TSM  
Nio  
Sofi  
Upst  
Afrm  
TDOC  


Now, I'm still young in my early 20s, so I can still tolerate some risk. I want to set aside a few selected choices from the above for long term (10-15 years) but more so look to take more risks with the next 3-5 years in mind.

I'd really appreciate advice you guys would have as to how I should allocate my money, and from the above what should I choose and focus on (and anything else you may think is better, I know I'm totally missing any Energy, don't much about it)

94,TSLA,1665851750.0,Looking for discussion- How far do you think TSLA stock could/should fall over the next year?,"Obviously in this unpredictable market it's possible that TSLA could recover and reach new all time highs, but for the sake of this discussion, assuming the market continues to tumble over the next 6 months, how low do you think TSLA will go?

(These are post stock split numbers)

For reference, TSLA is currently at 200 a share, down 50% from its ath of 400. So it could seem like a good deal at the moment. However when you look at it's 5 year chart (which a surprising amount of autists here never have), you see that it was at only 30 a share in January 2020 right before the covid madness. So it seems reasonable to assume it could still fall significantly more.

The thing with TSLA stock is people aren't just investing in a car company, they're investing in all of Elons other ventures. Selfishly, I'd like to see TSLA fall to around 100 a share and if it does I'll load up on stock and continue to do so. I absolutely could see TSLA reaching 1000 a share again in the future.
